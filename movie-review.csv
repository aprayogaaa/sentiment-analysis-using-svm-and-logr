AussieCritics,"Joker released on the 3rd of October, 2019 and grossed 4 million short of 100 million USD on it's opening weekend in the US.

It stars Joaquin Pheonix as Arther Fleck and Robert DeJoker released on the 3rd of October, 2019 and grossed 4 million short of 100 million USD on it's opening weekend in the US. Overall, Joker grossed nearly 1.1 billion dollars worldwide. It stars Joaquin Pheonix as Arther Fleck and Robert De Niro as Murray Franklin. So, how was it?Joker is possibly the most enjoyment I have ever had from a comic book movie. It is a dark and gritty character study of a psychopath. There is not a moment of this movie where I feel happy. It is very consistent with it's tone and the atmosphere is so gritty. The constant sirens, the trash on the streets, the graffiti on the subway, all of it contributes to a hopeless feeling. Joaquin Pheonix gives the best acting performance of his career, which is saying a lot. His laugh is one of the best Joker laughs, only beaten by Heath Ledger. His improvisation is on point and always feels consistent. When he commits a crime, he always gives you the feeling that deep down, he enjoys it. The cinematography is so incredible and the dark colour palette looks like its ripped out of the 80's.Joker is a great movie, but like all great movies, it is flawed. Rupert Pupkin from The King Of Comedy(1983) is very clearly an influence on this movie. And by influence, I mean they ripped his character nearly completely off. An unreliable narrator that tries his best to become a comedian and become famous. He fails and this, among other things, leads to him commiting a terrible crime. The personalities are different, but the storylines are quite similar. Todd Philips and Scott Silver also take influence from Taxi Driver(1979), another Scorcese film. Joker has the same obsession with guns and commits the same crime. Just because it isn't original doesn't mean it's bad, but it does have another issue. Joker's atmosphere can be a bit repetitive. Taxi Driver had a similar atmosphere, but it mixed it up a bit with jazz music being played. Joker is always sad, always depressing.8/10… Expand",8,0,"Apr  2, 2020"

Now this isn't to relate to this film's protagonist or sound like an edge lord but these marvel films are a ""roller coaster ride"" as Martin Scorsese describes them. Often times I compare the uncharacteristic MCU to the amazing writing and philosophy of the Halo series, halo is far more relatable to a group of superheros jumping around in CGI fights forever. I'd rather look up to the Arbiter, a self-sufficient dinosaur than a group of wimps.This leads to my main point about Joker, it is relatable. It surely isn't 100% relatable, as of course what the joker does in this film is immoral and unethical in every way, cant just go about killing people the way he did in this film. But, it is very realistic, its sad, its pessimistic and it shines a light on the reality that some mentally ill patients probably experience on a day to day basis. It also captures the reality of wealthy capitalists causing divisions between the rich and the poor in America (only in America, NOT IN THE UK) and other countries like Brazil. For instance, the game Max Payne 3 captures this pessimism in a similar way except Max is a hero rather than the anti-hero that is the Joker. This division of rich and poor is clear when you have to pay for healthcare in America and the fact that they advertise all sorts of health products there and make falsified claims about it goes to show on this division. Then again this isn't to get political, I don't agree with the idea of sparking a revolution because killing people isn't a good thing but this is a film and entertainment is of course for escapism. Understanding the Joker's mind and what he goes through was what we escaped into with this film and because of how realistic it is and emotional at times, it makes this film a master piece.Apparently Scorsese films influenced this film and I can 100% agree with this since I love his films. This is far better than a bunch of cgi fights and unrelatable content. Watch this if you're looking for a real film… Expand",10,0,"Apr 11, 2020"

This movie is far from disappointing, but ANYTHING would have been after all the hype this film got (supposed standing ovations at festivals and winning an award a bunch of best picture winners have won previously).Now, about the actual movie In a lot of ways, its Taxi Driver with a DC skin. It has the same tone and a lot of the same themes, but plot beats and base character motivations are drastically different. What you've heard about Phoenix's performance is all true, but I also loved the sometimes demented, sometimes classic style of cinematography and how the score would switch back and forth between sounding like what the character's perceived feelings on the events/situations were in a scene and what a sane person's perceptions of that same scene would be (triumphant vs. horrific).In addition to Jaoquin's performance, I thought that the few brief moments the supporting cast were given to play in were acted flawlessly as well. Zazzy Beats, Bryan Tyree Henry, and Deniro all had a brief moment to shine and they all took full advantage. I only have two real complaints about the film. First, I thought almost all additional tie-ins to the DC universe were the weakest parts of the movie. One with pearls felt particularly shoehorned in. And second, I wish the film had cut to black on the last line of dialogue Phoenix delivered. It would have been just a bit more effective than the more drawn out ending we got, I think, because that last line has some real punch to it. Maybe it would have felt cheesy. Lmk. Not a masterpiece, but I really enjoyed it and will definitely see it again.… Expand",7,0,"Apr 30, 2020"

When a ‘major’ movie is this simplistic and obviously just another copy of many other overrated downers – it leaves someone needing to explain how this nonsense then goes on to rate a ridiculous 11 OscarHow easily pleased have people become? When a ‘major’ movie is this simplistic and obviously just another copy of many other overrated downers – it leaves someone needing to explain how this nonsense then goes on to rate a ridiculous 11 Oscar nominations? Who can truly take the Oscars seriously any longer? Joker is a typical super-ugly, comic book R Rated serial killer story - which grinds its endless way through non-stop, grotesque situations of the most maudlin kind. We’ve already seen this character (somewhat over-played by Phoenix) far too many times in the past.  Even the dark, sleazy settings don’t invite interest, and has left many viewers wanting it all to end quickly but no, it drags on for over two hours, feeling painfully more like three. Then there’s the casting of an over-used De Niro, intended to help capitalise on some of those ‘gangster- obsessed’ Scorsese offerings. Many paid to see this over-hyped lowbrow tosh, expecting to experience a masterpiece - only to wish they could get back their time and money for better use. If uninspired morbidity is your thing, you’ll get a bellyful – otherwise, stay well away and watch this junk fade into the obscurity it deserves, hopefully, along with the copycat movie makers. The final images this movie creates of carnage on the streets of America, looks more like the sorry, robotic BLM mayhem that’s reducing the USA to a decaying mess.

The movie excels on telling a story about a slowly growing psychopath that gets where he is due to the society rejecting him, by showing it oppress Joker in a lot of ways that, while we don't agree at all with what he does at the end of the movie, we can't stop but feel sorry about him and even understand him a little. Speaking of the Joker, holy s*it, Joaquim Phoenix nailed on the role of the character! He managed to show us how a mentally ill man behaves without getting too much exaggerated to sound forced, he managed to give to us a brand new version of the character, which I enjoy WAY more than the original one, and it rivals with Robert Downey Jr to be the best actor to portray a comic book character until now. The direction is pretty solid, without any points where the quality of it decreases but without any highlights, and the soundtrack is really good. There are only two problems with the movie, the first being the guy that runs the television show, what he does during the movie doesn't make so much sense and it gets a bit ridiculous, I know that he is egocentric and all but that was simply way to unrealistic for me to ignore. The second one is that, despite Joaquim amazing performance, Arthur was not the most charismatic I have seen in a movie, outside of all the suffering and madness he goes through, I can't find much more character identity on him, we never saw him outside of an endless wheel of suffering that, I must admit, while good, started to get me tired on the last third of the movie. With that being said, the qualities overthrow the flaws, and the movie is really good, I just think while he performs everything very well, he excels at nothing outside Joaquim performance, and those two problems I stated previously really stop him from being a masterpiece, but he is worth your time. 8.5/10 Best DC movie.… Expand",8,1,"Dec  4, 2019"

Great  Cinematography, Shady Dark Ugly Retro settings, and music was good for normal person. I didn’t think to get such a Violent Deep scary movie from a director who directed all funny movies like The Hangover series..!! Secondly the name of Movie was quite oppotise to story. No doubt, ground breaking performance by Jaoquin. The person who lost his  20kg wight for pscyhc role.  Story of  Arthur Fleck ( Joker) A person who has history of multiple psychic disorders because of his horrible childhood, his mother also faced some mental issues. Arthur chooses to express his anger by killing the bad people, who didn't understood his mental condition, disporportional laugh according to situations.His expression of intolerance starts with killings of 3 men in a subway teasing a girl in a metro then his collegue who guides him in wrong way to take away his job,  then his colleague, his mom, then kills his favourite host of a famous reality show who uses people like him and mean while his expression of suppression gives him craze in old suppressed society which makes Joker feels Proud about him and ends up killing Thomas Wayne, the mayor of  Gotham and finally lands him in a Psychiatric ward. #PersonalOpinion: I think, there are two ways to express extreme level of  depression, one is by killing yourself ( Sucide), other is by killing those, who are reason of your depression. People reach at this Extreme level, when we ignore them, we don't listen what they exactly want to say, what they want us to understand, we simply assume more, reach at conculsions. If our so called civilized society will continue, this behaviour with one another, it will lead to a dark, disorganized and full of people with paradoxical laughter only.… Expand",9,0,"Dec  6, 2019"

Interesting, irreverent but still falls into the well know good vs. evil war, where things are never really full represented, but one way viewed.

Still, can't find the subtlety the theme needs to find truth and dimension on the character construction.

You could switch the name of this movie to Arthur and it wouldn’t change anything about how lacking this movie was of anything to do with DC’s Joker villain.

The character was absent of the ingenuity and dark cunning that are the fundamental characteristics that make its famous anti-hero the Joker. The characters story is all nearly encased in the typical socialist narrative to appeal to modern popular ideology.

This film is a malignant tumor on the collective psyche of society. I left the film feeling violated and disgusted. The only message this film sends is that the world is cold, cruel and uncaring and everyone in it is TERRIBLE. The plot is poorly constructed, the characters (ALL without exception) are flat, two dimensional and amoral. The rich are all insensitive pigs, and the poor are filthy, violent anarchists. No one has to take responsibility for their actions, because everyone else is to blame. The mental illness is poorly developed, he's supposed to be a vulnerable narcissist with some variation of tourette's, but instead he portrays as a schizophrenic with flat effect. Joaquin in this film has none of the Joker's infamous charisma or confidence. Instead he's portrayed as pathetic, grotesque and detestable. Furthermore, in this film the Joker is mentally, developmentally challenged, none of the Joker's ingenuity or wit. The whole film translates as a sob story told by a creatively challenged man. Maybe this whole film was supposed to be a sob story told to the psychiatrist, that would make it slightly less awful than it is. But not by a lot.

I expected it to appeal to a certain demographic, and it absolutely does. Phoenix's performance is stellar, which I expected given past performances in The Master and You Were Never Really Here, but the plot was predictable. I get it, it's an origin story, but if you stack it up against Ledger's performance, I don't like this Joker at all. It's Taxi Driver if Travis Bickle were a victim of abuse and overt mental illness. It mirrors that movie in many ways, but one thing I'll say for Travis, we didn't have to set him up as this ultimate victim. Unlike Ledger's Joker, a sociopath who would have made this Joker's past a lie to feign victimhood, throwing off his adversaries, Phoenix's Joker is a victim. He's a man with no agency who finds it in a gun. It's the dream of every incel and nutjob who's ever felt they were given a raw deal and finally snapped into a beautiful swan song of violence and retribution. What's truly terrifying about the joker is the mob. Much like Antifa or the alt-right today, the mob is looking for any excuse to be a mob, and they look to this broken man who's only claim to fame is shooting unarmed people (granted, the first time is in defense). It's as if the entire population of disaffected white 20-somethings rallied around Dylan Roof or the guy who shot up the theater in Colorado. Again, Phoenix's performance is legendary and he dives into this character. He is Arthur Fleck, who is a more interesting character to me than the Joker. I don't know if that was the intent of the film, but it kind of undercuts the agency of superheroes/villains. You don't walk away from Joker hating the bad guy. Many walk away on his side. On the side of the mob, where it's far easier to protest and react violently in the face of adversity than it is to actually do the hard work of fixing problems or people. It's the lazy internet route to social change that leaves the same problems covered in a layer of poopy pants that no one realizes how special someone is.

Admittedly great acting by JP... but I don't need a 2 hour movie to continually remind me he can play a crazy guy and lost a bunch of weight for the role.  His impressive skills are diluted by repetition, the movie just alternates between socially awkward scenes and shots of him shirtless so we can see his ribs.The movie and story is extremely boring.

Joker is a masterpiece of filmmaking, it is easily the most poignant comic book movie I've ever seen. It is all at once sad, tragic, deep, uncomfortable, yet never truly gratuitous - it is very nearly a perfect thing.Between this and the excellent Wonder Woman and Shazam, DC is on a roll.

“Coringa“ou “Joker”, lançado no dia 3 de outubro de 2019 no Brasil, levou críticas como: maravilhoso, épico, até críticas falando que o filme era extremamente violento.O filme que tanto se fala (sendo até concorrido ao Oscar) conta a história do maior super vilão do Batman, sendo um pouco diferente dos outros, focando mais na história do personagem do que no “tema ação”.Confesso que quando fui ver o filme achando que seria muito violento, porém não foi. Eu achei muito interessante o que o Coringa disse à sua assistente social, pois todo dia ela perguntava se ele estava tendo pensamentos negativos e em seu último dia com ela, ele respondeu que a única coisa que ele tem são pensamentos negativos, na minha opinião alguém não precisa ser doente para ter isso, mesmo sendo otimista; a maioria das pessoas tem pensamentos ruins (penso assim ser) e não precisa ser louco pra isso! Nele também mostra Thomas Wayne como um outro tipo de pessoa, como uma pessoa “má” ou ignorante, o que não mostra nos outros filmes, em Thomas era generoso e bom.Quanto ao fato da mulher que teria começado a namorar o Coringa, mostrando no final ser apenas um fantasia dele, e pra falar a verdade eu achei um pouco estranho desde do início, porque se as pessoas consideradas normais mal conseguem lidar com suas loucuras, imaginem com as de alguém realmente (ou diagnosticado) louco!Mas o filme é muito bom e as observações que eu fiz acima deixam ele ainda melhor, eu recomendo muito assistir.… Expand",10,1,"Dec 27, 2019"

I am a sucker for 'flawed narrative', where the star has denial which colors the facts of the movie (the best example id The Sixth Sense, 2nd best is the old silent movie The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari).  The director also made the Hangover series, of which the first one is excellent (mostly due to Mike Tyson and Bradley Cooper), this puts him in a whole other league, like Scorsese light. The cinematographer also did career best work here, everything looks like its inside an aquarium with beautiful muted greens and no primary colors anywhere.  This movie grossed almost $1b, an amazing feat in the time of cgi sequels, a real testament to the character and work of everyone involved.

Truthfully it hammers away at its audience that society treats the mentally ill, and anyone who is remotely different, terribly. If you were unaware of this fact and want to feel “artsy”, this film is for you. Otherwise it’s a hard pass. Review:A foreword, my personal bias may have tainted this review as it was impossible to escape the controversy leading up to this film. It was also unavoidable to ignore the way the movie bragged about copying other “art films”.Where to begin with the Joker. This film is beautifully shot, and thoughtfully tries to recreate the classic aesthetic of films like Taxi Driver or the King of Comedy. Joaquin Phoenix masterfully throws his all physically and emotionally into the ill mind of Arthur Fleck, aka the Joker. Sadly for all that the film tries to replicate, it remains just that; a replication. It lacks the true heart behind art films, and insists upon itself that it truly is a work of art. Let’s break down the two key elements the movie tries to convey. Mental Illness: While the movie tries to paint the image that Arthur is mentally ill, being diagnosed with a “vague disorder”; by the movie’s end it undoes the effort it puts in. We see Arthur hallucinate about being on TV or in a relationship with his neighbor, but these are short lived; he’s not delusional he’s daydreaming.  And the emotion Phoenix puts into these realizations show us that he knows what’s real and what’s not. Next let’s examine his nervous tick, his uncanny laughter. Ticks are not a mental illness, everyone has small ticks; this one is just unnerving. But rolling with this being a “sign of mental illness” is still hard to swallow, the execution and timing are off. His laughter is neither convenient for the plot, nor random enough to be a consistent piece of his character. The only consistency with his laughter is to show that society is mean. A great segue into the next theme:Cruel Society: It should be no shock to anyone that society and mobs can be cruel. However the citizens of Gotham seem to be an extra special brand of terrible. They go out of their way to not only berate and belittle Arthur, but to physically attack and assault him. In a movie based “in reality” I could not suspend belief long enough to imagine three Wayne Enterprise employees breaking into song together to attack a stranger. That brings us to the vengeance of Thomas Wayne. Now I was keen to see this take on Wayne. It makes sense for a man in his position to be a villain to Arthur. I could understand him being cruel, or two-faced; showing vile contempt for the man claiming to be his bastard son, while smiling and feigning charity while on camera. But this isn’t the case. Thomas Wayne is as cruel on camera as he is to Aruthur’s face. Is this really supposed to be the man championed as a Pillar of Gotham? Needless to say these two themes coalesce into Joker’s main point: If you are mentally ill, or different, or a minority, or look weird, society will treat you horribly. This should not be profound, nor does it need to be lauded. Nevertheless it spends 2 hours and 2 minutes elaborating on this until you feel sick. Actually to the film’s credit it does that quite well; it doesn’t forgive or excuse Arthur for his eventual crimes and murders. By the end you are horrified.… Expand",6,0,"Feb  1, 2020"

Some criticized that the film portrayed him as a sympathetic character. They warned about the social and political repercussions for doing so in today's society. While there are certain parallels that can be drawn with regards to the treatment of mental illness and other issues? Arthur Fleck / Joker is a violent character. We are never asked/expected to forgive Arthur/The Joker for his actions. The film is able to walk that line (pun not intended) between offering a commentary on our own society and that of portraying a notorious maniac that has endured as one of the best foils and villains in pop culture to date. In fact it's a testament to how well executed this film is that you only are given the slightest connection to the greater Batman canon. Joker has always been more compelling as a psychological villain and we see that transformation unfold on screen. Due to Phoenix's excellent performance the film stands on it's own as one of the best adaptations of a comic book character. Whether you prefer Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger or Joqauin Phoenix?

As far as I am concerned this movie is an insult to the fans of Batman and the REAL Joker.The “Joker” in this move is a unintelligent deranged nutcase. There is a sob story in the background about how he became that way which is totally uninteresting.The REAL joker is a intelligent criminal mastermind. I was waiting for this nutcase to actually become that for the entire movie. Spoiler alert, it never happened! This guy starts as a useless sobbing nutcase and he ends the movie as the same useless sobbing nutcase.The movie has NOTHING to do with the real Joker. It is a blatant attempt to garner support for a unrelated psychopathic thriller by using the Joker name. If it would have been advertised as such I probably would have, if not liked it, so at least appreciated it for it’s qualities. It is indeed a well done movie technically and the main character is indeed excellently performed.However, even if I try to distance myself from the deceitful Joker label, I find it overall boring, too long and really a movie about a psychopath probably made by someone with mental issues himself. But then that’s Hollywood today.That the politically biased and elitist so called “critics” on sites like Rotten Tomatoes like it is not really surprising but I have to confess that I am somewhat surprised at the rave ratings by real viewers on some other sites.Honestly, I was expecting to be disappointing by this movie.

To be honest, I am probably going to watch it again within the week.In addition, the Joker shines light on how Hollywood has lost its way (just like Gotham :)). Contemporary movies lack all of the essentials of a good movie whereas the Joker capitalizes and delivers on those lost arts.

Up until the final half an hour I leaned towards a 2-3/10, but it finally managed to produce some tense, if predictable scenes. Funnily enough, the movie got better when the titular character started resembling more of its classic version, while all the ""bold reimagining"" only managed to produce an unlikeable and unrelatable loser.From the technical standpoint, Joker looks slick with pretty good cinematography. As for acting, Phoenix grimaces too hard here, and I was overall left unimpressed. Have to give credit for the severe weight loss he underwent for the role, though. The music, while mostly fitting, sometimes also adds to the already overly-forced sobbing atmosphere with the least subtle violin ever played. The handful of Batman references here are largely unnecessary for the plot and only work to sell the movie to the broader audience, which, as we all know, worked out pretty well.All in all, Joker tries to be pretentious, artsy and deep, but is only capable to churn out an outplayed moral that our society is toxic and violent, an overacting Phoenix and a few bloody scenes to look more edgy.

В общем сюжет картины превосходен, но в реализации чувствуется небольшой бюджет, и из за этого имеются касяки в самом фильме: в моменте когда Феникс выходит на сцену в облике джокера, выбрасывая сигарету, видно как за кулисами один из людей съемочной группы убирает данную сигарету. Касяк был в стабилизации камеры: в некоторых моментах было поддергивание камеры. Касяк в пулевых ранениях: когда Феникс кого то убивал, то сзади жертвы вылетала кровь, но этого не могло быть, тк пистолет из которого убивали не мог сделать сквозное пулевое отверстие.

Last decade DC has shown that some directors really ruin some legends, but 2k19 showed us this amazing, well written movie. Heath ledger's performance as the joker was in my opinion better. But Joaquin Phoenix gave us another great joker performance. He cleary showed Jared Letto that joker isn't just a character that anyone can play. The movie itself, is a masterpiece. Every performance in it is played so well. I also like how society reacts on the riots that happaned because of three killed people. Amazing!

For me it’s one that tells a story, makes you want to keep watching, evokes emotion, makes you forget you are merely watching actors on a set interpreting a script. The joker did all this for me.A fly on the wall you watch as a man tries to keep it together, with a brutal childhood he holds on to the only nice reassuring sentence ever spoken to him. That his existence was to make people laugh & be happy. With this idea in mind & Band-Aid fix medication a schizophrenic suicidal maniac courageously keeps it together & but it’s not enough. The world in all its selfish cruelty coupled with his disability hindering his mission, the very idea of himself is chipped away.  Slowly the Band-Aid comes off and with the right amount of cruelty he is pushed over the edge with deadly release.  You watch on as a monster emerges in front of your eyes. He sheds the past memories & his old skin, off the leash not caring if he lives or dies. Do you like him? No, but can you hate him? Finally accepted with the open arms of Gotham’s downtrodden he learns his true purpose. To entertain though misery & chaos. Well cast, acted & directed mature depiction of the Joker. Was the director trying to make a statement on the real world about nature of nature & victim blaming? Who knows it’s irrelevant because all that matters is the Joker’s reality as we sit back and watch his story emerge not yours.… Expand",8,1,"Jan  9, 2020"

It reeks of property cash in and that's what destroys the possibility for this being a great movie... that and the writersThis movie fell short of its potential, held back by a desperate attempt to push the story into the world of Gotham. It reeks of property cash in and that's what destroys the possibility for this being a great movie... that and the writers don't seem to understand character Arthur as they can't keep his profile straight. This COULD have been a masterpiece but they demolished everything they created with a search and replace of a dark grim reality with the words ""Gotham"", ""Wayne"", and ""Joker"". So it results with a rating of ""yeah that was a movie"" instead of ""wow what a statement"".Everyone has their opinion of what this movie ""is"" but I'm going to tell you it's not about mental health, it's not about the character the Joker or the world of DC, it's not about an incel, and it's definitely not about social inequality. This is not your hero. It's not deep, it's not riveting, and it barely scratches the surface of what it's attempting.This is failed character development in a movie that went from amazing to what the heck am I watching 50 minutes in. This movie was about making money. Plain and simple. The story is convoluted and confused. It NEEDS to be part of the DC universe and that is actually what ruins it. Reality is far more grim than Gotham and that alone pulls away any impact this movie had.For an ""origin story"" the movie spends only 10ish minutes establishing who Arthur is, only to completely pivot away from that and demolish his character with decisions he would never make. It abandons the plot of his own character for a tie-in with Thomas Wayne repeatedly, which feels forced and unwanted. If you cut out all of the Gotham references and change the ending it would be a much better film, but it would have made less than half the money and not had a gaggle of fanboys drooling over it for two years.Is this movie worth watching? Sort of. It's not ""good"" because of everything I mentioned and the script is just not great. It gets mental health completely wrong. It has bad character development. Literally nothing makes sense and no one in this movie has any importance or relevance outside of Arthur, who the movie establishes as two maybe even three different characters. It falls way short of establishing social equity and the importance of humanism.Anyone giving this over an 8 is merely grasping at the straws meant to build this into a failed version of the DC character Joker. Anyone actually analyzing this movie and the characters for what they are would rate this below a 7. It's bad writing. It's bad character development. The plot is convoluted. It's a cash in. Most of all it's an art house film trying to be mainstream that doesn't know it is badly written. Todd Phillips knows how to do one thing right, make money off of stupid people. His history of movies definitely proves that.In the end this movie will get undeserved awards for all of the wrong reasons and critically acclaimed for a sad reach that writers need to be liked and get clicks. In the end this was not a great movie and it will be forgotten and left behind. I think the fact it's getting a sequel actually proves this is a cash-in and not worth your time. This should have made its statement, should have been a real world not a fictional one, and it should have been left there.Joker can be summed up in one word I went to over and over again... desperate.… Expand",5,4,"Jan 14, 2020"

This is a flawed, yet very, very good film. The main problem I had with it was the lack of realism pertaining to the descent to madness. Particularly, a talk show host making fun of you and flat out bullying you? Or a group of kids randomly jumping you? If you look at a superior film with this subject matter in Taxi Driver, you see a much more realistic and nuanced descent. Not to mention, while I like the homage to that film, at times it feels like a cheap knock off of it.It has lovely shots.

Now, I intentionally avoided seeing this movie when it came out.Well, I FINALLY got around to seeing the controversial and wildly popular film, Joker: the most profitable comic book movie and the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time. Now, I intentionally avoided seeing this movie when it came out. Not because I wasn’t interested in seeing it or because I thought I wouldn’t like it, but because of the hype and the controversy. Seemingly, all the reactions were either “If you like this movie, you’re an incel and a school shooter!” or “If you don’t like this movie, you’re an SJW and a shill!” and I just hate that black-and-white mentality when it comes to movies, or anything really. I find it really obnoxious. I was sick of hearing about it everywhere so I just stayed away. However, months later, the hype has died down, no one has gotten shot or killed because of this movie and it’s finishing its theatrical run. I paid $5 and saw it at the second-run theatre. What did I think of it? I loved it, but this movie is not perfect. I’ll get the negatives out of the way first since there aren’t a lot of them. I thought the writing was way too unsubtle, obvious and on-the-nose. This film is very clear about what it is saying and it hits you on the head with it, almost like they’re dumbing it down for audiences who aren’t used to watching introspective dramas like this and otherwise wouldn’t if it weren’t based on a famous comic book supervillain. It can make you roll your eyes sometimes. There weren’t too many of those moments for me, but your mileage my vary. Also, there really was no point in setting this in the late 70s/early 80s. I know it’s paying homage to famous Joker stories from the 80s like The Killing Joke and The Dark Knight Returns, as well as Martin Scorsese movies from the 70s and 80s like Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, but you can do an homage without making a period piece. You could set the story in modern-day and it wouldn’t change at all. In fact, some things would make more sense if it were set in a world of social media and mobile phones. You’ll see what I mean if you see the movie. I also think some aspects of this movie would’ve been stronger if they showed rather than told. This movie needed more flashbacks, it would’ve been way more powerful. However, with all that said, I still loved it. I thought it was great. This movie is not fast. It’s not fun. There isn’t much action or comedy. It’s darker and more serious than The Dark Knight. Just know that going in. This is not your typical comic book movie. It’s more A History of Violence than The Dark Knight. Joaquin Phoenix’s performance as the titular character is INCREDIBLE. He’s both sympathetic and scary and adds so many little nuances and special touches to his performance to make it completely his own. This Joker is very much unlike any other Joker we’ve gotten in other movies. It was refreshing, especially after the Suicide Squad fiasco. A lot of the other performers aren’t half bad either, it was cool to see Robert DeNiro in a comic book movie. This movie is beautiful. It’s shot really well and I loved the setdressing. Everything is dirty and grimy and disgusting with garbage everywhere, we’re a long way from the Gotham City of Joel Schumacher’s Batman movies! The score was also haunting and beautiful, with some great music choices for the soundtrack. No Twenty One Pilots here! I also thought this movie was really thematically rich and relevant. It has tons of social commentary about mental health, class, bullying, abuse, trauma, social isolation, gun violence, the media and more. Some might say this film bites off more than it can chew, it does try to juggle a lot of different themes at once, but I think it worked. This movie also connects with the larger mythology of Batman in very clever ways, leaving the door open to possible sequels and spinoffs. I don’t want that, personally, but it’s cool that this movie is also a Batman origin story, in a way. Joker and Batman are still two parts of a whole, even in Joker’s own movie. Overall, Joker is a flawed but great movie. It’s not for everyone and I definitely understand where a lot of the criticism of the film itself is coming from, but I still loved it and recommend it to any fan of psychological character studies or crime dramas, not just superhero movies. I hope it wins some Oscars!… Expand",8,0,"Jan 23, 2020"

Of the two I've spoken to that walked out halfway through the film, both are delusionally cynical, falsely optimistic people who are excruciating to deal with, so devoid of genuine humanism they are.And that's the point. The critics who insult this film with their offensively ignorant and dismissive reviews are the morally aloof, narcissistic tunnel-visionists who refuse to accept that their failure to acknowledge and grasp the pain and suffering of the most unfortunate and abused members of society is precisely what turns the Arthur Flecks of this world into Jokers. This film puts them on trial, and the verdict is guilty.Beautiful, haunting, and unforgettable, Joker offers a rare glimpse into how and why a heart can sink into darkness. Phoenix's brilliant, selfless performance fills that space in the shadow cast by the nearsighted, villainous Ayn Rands of this world, the ones who fail to offer compassion and understanding to those who need it most.This is the desperately necessary, bloody-brush-stroked 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' that sensitive, disgusted millennials have been waiting for. It's a hymn of outrage in a time of political despair and tyranny of truth, and it's the best picture of 2019.… Expand",10,1,"Jan 24, 2020"

This film is very different, it's a very different storyline. The script is very well written, it demonstrates well the mental insanity of the protagonist, which propagates in the dialogues. Todd Phillips' direction is very well done, obviously it is a very different job compared to his work on The Hangover, here his direction is invasive and cautious. We can not fail to mention the magnificent and anthological performance of Joaquin Phoenix, who is sensational, it is really difficult to express words to describe this fantastic performance. Another incredible point of the film is its soundtrack, which is very good and deserves to win an Oscar. Joker is a very heavy film, it really is not for anyone. The film presents the basic coalitions with the D.C universe, but the focus in this film is really the presentation of the origin of the joker. I will make a small mention of Robert de Niro's performance, which despite doing a simple and basic performance, is an interesting performance that has a lot to do with the main character's arc. To conclude, Joker is a film that, despite being very heavy, is a beautiful character study, with a very good script, and a magnificent performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Oscar winner.… Expand",10,1,"Jan 27, 2020"

I think not. Welcome back everyone! This week we were able to viewJoker But Not A JokeKnock, knock. Who’s there? Stream to Big Screen. Stream to Big Screen, who? Stream to Big Screen the best site for movie reviews on the internet! Corny? I think not. Welcome back everyone! This week we were able to view the highly anticipated movie, Joker, starring Joaquin Phoenix. Joker is a standalone origin film of many people’s favorite DC Comics villain. The movie is set in the worst of times in Gotham where violence is rampant, civil unrest is prevalent, and the rodent population is no joke. This movie follows Phoenix as the main character, Arthur Fleck. Arthur is a young man longing to fit in and aspiring to be a comedian but is dealing with a bevvy of issues, primarily mental illness. The film leads us through Arthur’s path to becoming the titular Joker.While this movie is titled Joker, the theme/takeaway from this movie is no joke. Ultimately, this movie hits way too close to home for American society presently. The bullied, belittled, forgotten person in society deals with mental illness without an appropriate support system, and he has access to a gun. This storyline has become an all too familiar in mainstream media today. For this reason, Joker is a very good conversation piece. But didn’t we come to see a movie based on a comic book? This isn’t what I wanted! Well, this is important to know. DON’T go into this movie expecting a comic book like story or a connection to the comics, other than the name.With that said, Warner Bros. couldn’t have found a better or more experienced lead actor than Phoenix. Phoenix definitely has practice acting like a power seeking maniac begging to be remembered. I’m looking at you Commodus! From the beginning to the end, Phoenix takes us through every single range of emotion Arthur experiences. It truly is quite impressive. Phoenix’s acting and the movie provide a great feeling of anxiety, not necessarily suspense, throughout. Unfortunately, the director either held Phoenix back or chose to feature too many early movie boring set up scenes. When Phoenix acts his craziest, the movie is epic but there is just far too little of it to get over the boring parts. In a way, I felt deceived by the intense commercials and trailers. We’ve been waiting for nearly a year to see this movie. Yes, the movie provides a few intense moments but far too few. And, far too little of Zazie Beetz! Honestly, they could’ve interchanged her with any actress to do the same thing. Nevertheless, her presence was still welcomed.And then when I wasn’t bored, I was predicting exactly what was supposed to be a surprise or twist in the movie. I’m not sure if it was the scene selection or a purposeful directorial decision, but at times the same scenes just didn’t make sense when I was watching them. Eventually, my suspicions were confirmed and I just said ,”duh!”All of that said, Joker delivers in some aspects (I didn’t even mention the great score in the movie) but ultimately will let you down. Joaquin does a good job as the Joker, but he’s never going to be regarded like a Heath Ledger once the dust settles. Try to check this movie out at a matinee time, if your a big Joker/DC fan. Everyone else, you may be disappointed in a matinee price but for a reasonable price it’s worth it or an early streaming rental.The Stream: Takes unbelievably long to get moving and then supremely predictable.The Big Screen: Joaquin delivers an uneven performance but worth watching.The Final Bill: Joker is an overhyped film that will create some conversations about mental health issues in society.-S2S: Movie Review… Expand",7,0,"Jan 28, 2020"

It's got all the right pieces to the puzzle and with a more thorough execution would be right there. I think making this movie 3 hours long, showing a little more of his descent into madness, and really capitalizing on the final few scenes and not leaving you with the ending that it did really would have put this to number 1 for me but above all it's still a really good film.

Being a fan of the character and the DC Universe in general, my jaw continuously kept dropping to the floor during this film. This has got to be one of the biggest joys I’ve had in a cinema for a long time. I was so unrealistically excited for this film that before walking in it dawned on me that maybe I had made a mistake, maybe I had overhyped myself but no oh god no, this film is excellent. With an Oscar worthy performance from Joaquin Phoenix and skilful directing behind the camera from Todd Phillips, Joker drags you into the mind of a man being boiled alive by the people and customs surrounding him.My biggest complaint for this film would have to be how boldly it wears its influences on its sleeves (that being Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy). Nearing the end of the film it did start to dawn on me just how similar the structures of these films were but it wasn’t enough to annoy or disgust me, just a little too blatant for my liking.But overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this roller coaster and will defiantly be seeing it again as soon as I can.

We all know critic reviews are worthless. Most critic sites are paid off to give good reviews, which is something everyone has been aware of for a long time.The movie is fantastic. Its too real. We see a seriously mentally ill man being cast aside by society. After losing his access to therapy and medication, we see him slowly descend into darkness. The tone of the movie is largely dark and sinister. The turning point is when he decides to commit suicide. The elated giddiness of an mentally ill person finally making this decision is only relatable for someone who has gone through the same thing. He takes power into his own hands. The music and lighting becomes more cheery. The second turning point is near the end, when he realizes once he has taken the power back over his life and finally feels happy, he no longer wants to die.He felt ignored by society and once he takes a stand against the absurdity of it, he sees there are other people just like him. They see him.  The negative reviews are by the exact same people the movie is calling out. Or they expected another generic action movie and got a dark drama.This movie didn't have to be about Joker.

This is an outstanding movie. The thing about it is, I went into it thinking ""Oh yay! A Batman movie!"" Thinking it was gonna be like 'the killing Joke' when this really isn't like any other movie, and it's definitely not like any other comic book movie. If you came to this movie for the Joker, go watch a dark night. If you come to this movie for a drama about mental illness and a stand alone story, then you got it. There really is nothing like Phoenix's acting in this movie either. He really does make you feel bad for Arthur and makes you look at how the world discriminates and I think that's why I give it a 10/10. It's just a masterpiece. Now, do keep in mind this isn't a movie for young to watch either. It is rated R for a reason. It takes on a VERY dark tone. More then movies such as 'The Shining' even.

Todd Phillips does a good job bringing a late 1970's Gotham city to life, as the city looks bleak and gothic. It sets the mood for the film, as Arthur is persecuted and mistreated. As Arthur's mental health diminishes he looses his mental health treatment and eventually looses his mind. He first murders some yuppies who were harassing a woman on the subway. He then murders a coworker and his mother. At this point he is dawning the Joker make-up and purple suit with green hair and referring to himself as the Joker. He goes on a talk show to exact revenge on the late night host Murray, played by Robert DeNiro, who had humiliated him. He shoots Murray in the head and this is televised. In the movie, the Joker inspires some sort of revolutionary movement of the common man against elites, though he claims this was unintended. There are riots in the streets and as a result Bruce Wayne's parents are murdered setting up his origin. I liked the movie, it was suspenseful and kept you guessing, but felt like the Joker character in the movie wasn't faithful enough to the lore as he lacked Joker's abilities and proficiency in chemistry and crime as he was depicted in the original Batman from 1989 and the Dark Knight. Joker from Batman in 1989 and The Dark Knight in 2008 was more true to the source material. Still a solid movie.… Expand",8,1,"Jun 18, 2021"

Because that movie has nothing to do with his world. No matter how hard the movie tries, it can't get anything out of itself, especially by taking the acting from the lead role. A film in which there is no violence, but it tries to use it with fear. A film that is not only artificial but also does not any style...acting??!! And only talks boringly.

I had always wanted to watch a superhero movie that has absolutely no CGI whatsoever and actually be good. The most iconic villain in the entertainment history had never been given a backstory, so it was necessary to be made as good as possible without actually ruining it (read Catwoman). Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Arthur Fleck is great. You can actually see the painful life he goes through everyday. The way he slowly dances in the bathroom with an eerie music score makes him look natural; something the actual Joker would also do if this happened in Batman: The Killing Joke.Many scenes in the movie were actually really unexpected. When Randall gives him a gun and tells him to use it for his self defence, it seems as though his friends really care for him. But later he snitches on Arthur, which completely changes our perception of him. Also the way the Wayne Enterprise employees were beating up Arthur on the subway made it feel like a drag initially, because we had understood that he is an outcast having a bad day, but then when he suddenly shoots them all it gives the chills. And of course, the part where Joker shoots Murray on a live show. I was expecting he will kill Murray AFTER the show ends.And finally the way they ended the movie was also pretty good. Since one of the characteristics of the Joker is that he does not have a definite story, it did make sense that most, if not almost all, events take place in his head, as it could all be considered non canonical if the fans didn't like it. This movie truly deserves the Oscar for both the categories it won - Joaquin Phoenix's acting and the music score.The only one problem I had with this movie is Joker's costume. I would have preferred if he wore his signature purple suit instead of a red one, since that would have actually been more true to its core. But other than that I was completely good with everything in this movie.… Expand",10,0,"Mar 20, 2021"

Yet, it doesn't just sandwich concepts from other films, but brings with it a variety of new tools that didn't exist in that era of filmmaking, such as the ability to show some sympathy to these malignant figures and see that their struggle is ours, and warns us all of the potential danger of leaving loose threads frayed for too long.… Expand",10,0,"May  1, 2020"

This film gave me one of the most unique cinematic experiences I’ve ever had. Phoenix’s performance was one of the best performances I could recall ever seeing after leaving the theatre, better than just the best performance of 2019. I was in disbelief that the person I was watching on the screen was Joaquin Phoenix - from start to finish he was unrecognizably dedicated to playing the role and very highly emotionally provocative for the audience. The cinematography was phenomenally uncomfortable, the score was hauntingly brilliant, the supporting cast were well selected, and the movie pacing was uniquely captivating. This was also the best Gotham city setting to me so far. The film setting drew me in and made me feel filthy. The metaphors and the score from the film were particularly powerful. There is ever present audience gripping tension starting from the first minute of the film until the end. You could really feel the emotional involvement of the audience in the theatre. The final 45 minutes of this film are truly some of the best cinema ever produced.

HisInitially when I heard the lead was Joaquin, I was excited because it was quite obvious he is one of the best actors around. And then the reviews made it sound like a flop so I thought maybe it's not that good. God, I was wrong. His performance as the Joker was spectacular, even reaching to the point that I felt the Joker was not wrong to be who he became. Arthur started off as a depressed man without any light in his life. But it was the way Joaquin physically portrayed someone with a psychotic disorder with so much detail, he never once overdid it. His physique is one of a broken bullied man and his eyes reflect Arthur's tormented soul. The direction of the movie was terrific as well by focusing on the internal breakdown of Arthur's mind. The movie was so painful, realistic and never too dramatic, that I was captivated throughout. Despite Heath Ledger's amazing performance, I think it is no way comparable to this Joker. However, to be fair, Heath did not get the same size of the role. I would strongly recommend it to anyone, especially DC fans to see this movie with legendary acting so rare.… Expand",10,0,"May 16, 2020"

People robbed of allWhat a huge disappointment, I was expecting so much more!The movie sets out to sell me a point that's already sold, namely that a society that forgets and marginalizes have-nots is a bad idea, even leaving ethics alone. People robbed of all hope and with nothing to lose, will not play by the rules, it's something Dickens made crystal clear in ""A Tale of Two Cities"" almost two centuries ago.And yet the protagonist almost manages to sway me towards the despicable Thomas Wayne's selfish, paternalistic plutocracy. Fortuna may be Imperatrix Mundi, but you are rarely completely powerless in the face of events. Arthur is unlucky, but not as much as he thinks. Just like you are not fit to be an angel for Victoria's Secret if you are an obese, ugly, middle-aged man, you are not fit to be a stand-up comedian if you are a tragically unfunny guy, with a condition that makes you break up in laughter at the worst possible moment. Wanna make one of those schmaltzy, inspirational movies about pursuing a dream in the face of adversity? Well, the people in those, WORK HARD to fulfil their dream. Arthur does absolutely nothing but wallow in excessive self-pity, while smoking one cigarette after the other after the other after the other after the other... does he accept any job to make ends meet, while perfecting his act? Oh noes, that would be sooo below him. He's ""made to spread joy onto the world"", so he should be handed his dream on a plate. And hey, he's too busy pitying himself to get a new job, after he lost the one he had because of *his* incredible stupidity. But no, it's not his fault, right? It's society's, and mainly rich people's, so he's perfectly right in spending his days crying and smoking and laughing maniacally.Really, I'm so angry that a perfectly valid message gets wasted this way!

Well, that was dark...  I do have some trouble with specific dark content as it usually strays away from the artistic wonder that it needs to serve a purpose.  When I walked in to see this film, I had butterflies in my tum-tum as I didn't know how the dark subject matter could be handled.  Then I saw this experience.  I love this film for the same reason that I love A Clockwork Orange.  **** up content that is handled with dignity.  Making the audience empathise with Arthur until he lashes out.  It's a perfect balance.  The score is masterful, Joaquin Phoenix's performance actually makes me jealous on how good it is.  I do say that it does have some issues such as Bruce Wayne being involved for fan service.  (However, I do like how they recreated Batman's origin). There really wasn't any importance with him and the illusions do seem a bit of an excuse for some flaws such as Joker shooting Murray because, ""why does that camera keep broadcasting this""? or ""How come Murray didn't expect Joker to game-end him with a gun""?

Like Arthur, who sits in a dark room and fantasises about a better life, Phillips's Joker wants so badly to be something more than a superhero (or supervillain?) movie.It tries to be a critique to modern society, but fails at being realistic.It tries to be an elegy to nihilism, but its protagonist is more of a common criminal than an Übermensch.It tries to be complex, but its black and white perspective makes it something you would expect in fanfiction. There is nothing new in Arthur's descent into madness and more importantly there is no real conflict. The viewer knows from the start what will happen, he knows that Arthur is supposed to be the victim who finally snaps and gets revenge on the real bad guys (namely everyone else). This movie feels like a ""gut punch"" to some people because of its emotional intensity - but is this feeling genuine? Or is there something more to it? The writers tried to make Arthur Fleck as real as possible, to make him a tragic character, but in the end it looks like they googled ""Buttmonkey"" and built him around that concept.… Expand",7,0,"Nov  5, 2019"

Any ways The movie was just ok. It was well Directed and the acting was good, Story was alright. My problems with it are going in I just thought Phoenix was Miscast as the Joker and after seeing it, well it just confirms I was right. I can admit when I'm wrong cause I thought the same thing with Downey as Ironman and Heath ledger as the Joker but completely changing my mind after I saw the movie. Phoenix is just to old to play the Joker, He looks 50 on top of that his voice just doesn't carry any weight of insanity nor do I buy him as the Joker. Now I do think Phoenix is a good actor and I think he was trying his best to do it but he just doesn't pull it off for me. I also hated the make up job for the Joker. It just didn't look right. He looked like a normal clown instead of a Insane one.The Script is pretty good I like its Darker tone. I'm getting bored of these copy paste comic book movies. I want some thing Darker and edgier and this does deliver on that. It does take awhile for it to get going but we do get to see the Jokers slow decent into madness, which is done pretty good. If they could have just found the right actor for the Joker this could have been a 8 or maybe even a 9 from me. Who should have played the Joker? I dont know I really dont follow who the young actors are out there so I dont know who should have been cast for the part but he should have been younger like mid to late 20s considering Batman is only like 11 or 12 in this.

If anything, it's a Scorsesian roundup in which minor works are often better than major ones, and Todd Phillips is adept at paying homage also to the first ones, from the sequences on the stairs of ""New York, New York"" (1977) to the ambulances of ""Bringing Out the Dead"" (1999). It's a film that flows fast, but that is so much a merit as a defect: for example, there is no serious deepening of the (bidirectional?) link between psychic discomfort and social unease, a ""praise of folly"" more exhibited than explained, or of the problematic integration of subjectivity into the Warholian world of entertainment (and in fact the failed seminarian dedicated an entire film to each of these aspects). In short, it lets itself be seen, often even to its detriment. And I would have left the invasion of mice at the Camus of ""La Peste"" (1947).… Expand",6,2,"Nov 14, 2019"

Es una pelicula demasiado grandiosa, el hecho de combinar la realidad y relacionarlo con un personaje de un comic haciendolo ver de una manera surrealista que podria suceder en la actualidad y de hecho le da el toque de enves de  comvertirlo en una simple pelicula puede ser una historia completamente real, de hecho los casos de asesinos con problemas psicologicos son relativamente parecidos. En mi opinion, puede ser visto de muchas maneras, como a la par verlo como un llamado a la sociedad el cual el mensaje sea la tolerancia y el respeto por los demas, el ponerse en los zapatos de la otra persona y comprender que no todos tenemos la misma vida con ventajas o desventajas, como a la vez un simbolo de revelion para otros ya que tambien vivimos en una sociedad donde la moral esta por los suelos cuando uno asiende hacia el poder y es el pueblo mismo quien debe sufrir esa falta de etica por parte del gobierno. Simplemente tiene muchos mensajes sobre la realidad que vivimos hoy en dia y como ya se establecio antes, esto es a manera de entretenimiento solo es una pelicula para ver y reir o llorar un rato de la realidad en la se convirtio el mundo.

The Joker was one of the most recurring villains in them. Yet it wasn't until BatmanAs a kid I loved superhero comics, as it happens, my parents owned a collected volume of (pre-super) Batman comics. Good stories, if a bit corny in spots. The Joker was one of the most recurring villains in them. Yet it wasn't until Batman TAS that Mark Hamill's performance as a voice-actor really brought the Joker to life. For most of my life I felt that the Joker was a perfect if cartoony villain. Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger did amazingly well in the live-action portrayals, but Hamill still did it best. So... my brother and I have been trying to spend a bit more time together as we do not have a lot of family left. We have gone to see a few movies and we both enjoyed comics as kids, so Joker (which I'd heard good things about) was a natural choice. And we were both blown away. This review is just my personal opinion mind and I will strive to keep away from spoilers.Primarily, Joker is not a super-hero story. It is a psychological drama set against a fictional city, containing characters with recognisable names all from a comicbook franchise. But it is not a fantasy-filled spandex-fest. Todd Phillips has made this movie in quite a different way than I had imagined possible. It is a story about one unhappy, mentally and emotionally scarred man trying to live in a city that has severe issues. Over the course of the movie, in which these worsen and throughout which Phillips makes the viewer wonder what is real, we follow Arthur Fleck's descent if not into madness than to and beyond the breaking point. The climax of the movie perfectly encapsulates this: if you keep pushing someone, then you will get what you deserve.It is a phenomenal artwork, this movie. And Joaquin Phoenix has played his role as Arthur perfectly. Scratch Letho, that was a cartoon character done badly. Phoenix on the other hand has portrayed a human being. A broken man in a **** of a city living in utter misery... You get why what happens, happens. I cannot praise Phoenix enough here as he has made the Joker an actual human being. Something that only occurred in rare flashes throughout the comics, say at the end of The Killing Joke. As a viewer of the movie, you will be touched by this. Hopefully, it will inspire you, or at the least promote empathy.The rest of the cast also manages to come across as genuine. The lone mother, the social worker, the asshat office workers... They can be found on Earth as well.To address the critic reviewbombs: Not all movies are intended to be sugarcoated stories for mentally challenged babies. Functional violence, deep themes and complex issues in a morally grey story have their place in movies. Heck, any form of fiction. Joker deserves all the awards it can get and then some. It is clear why this movie does better than the parodious Batwoman.… Expand",10,0,"Nov 17, 2019"

No, as the slow yet sure descent to madness 'psychological thriller' was a staple in the 70's.  Taxi Driver...A Dog Day's Afternoon...Joker paid a handsome homage to these flicks. Kudos also to Phoenix's incredibly committed performance as Arthur Fleck aka the Joker.  It is an incredible feat that will probably land him an Oscar Nomination, and a highly probable win. Yet again, why just an '8'?

That alone is a minor miracle.

He is magnetic in the role; you can’t take your eyes off him. Watching him transform from Arthur Fleck into The Joker is a thing of dark, somber beauty. There is a line in the movie that says “I use to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize it’s a comedy.” make no mistake, watching a mentally ill person that is shunned by a society which lacks empathy, slowly deteriorate into a homicidal maniac, is a tragedy. This movie hits hard and doesn’t hold back with its message.The score by Hildur Guðnadóttir is brilliant. She manages to capture the mood of the setting and Arthur’s mindset so well. I can’t imagine the movie without this score. The cinematography is great. The colours, the lighting, the close-ups of Joaquin, and in particular, a shot of Joker standing on top of a cop car embracing the chaos he inspired, it’s a thing of beauty. I also liked the addition of a couple of songs from the era it’s set in. Props must be given to the supporting cast, even though they didn’t have too much to do because of the movie’s strong focus on Arthur, but did great with what they had, in particular, Robert Deniro.And lastly, the biggest surprise from this movie, is the director, Todd Phillips. When I first heard the news of a Martin Scorsese produced Joker origin movie, the hype within started. Then Joaquin Phoenix got attached to the leading role; the hype picked up the pace. And then Todd Phillips, the director of The Hangover Trilogy attached to direct, the breaks on the hype train were pulled or at least slowed down. I kept the faith that’d be good because if the project had Scorsese and Phoenix interested in it, then it had to be good, so I backed their judgment and subsequently backed Phillips, and I must say, they got it right. I hope to see more serious movies from Todd Phillips; the guy can pull them off.If you want to see a tour-de-force performance from one of the world’s best actors and a hard-hitting movie that doesn’t hold back its punches and doesn’t apologize for them, if you want to be left speechless by the end, then you have to see this movie. It is one of the best films of 2019, and the hype of its brilliance couldn’t be any more correct. The movie is not about an incel who couldn’t get laid, so he goes loco, like some of the media are portraying it to be. This movie is a warning about society’s inability to deal with its unfortunate inhabitants in an empathic way. It’s funny how the media lays into these “incels” as some of the characters lay into Arthur in the movie. Life imitating art, I guess.… Expand",9,0,"Nov 23, 2019"

La belleza de Joker está envuelta por una ambientación tétrica, depresiva, caótica, en una ciudad sucia,Joker es la película basada de un cómic más poderosa, bella y trascendental desde El Caballero de la Noche de Christopher Nolan. La belleza de Joker está envuelta por una ambientación tétrica, depresiva, caótica, en una ciudad sucia, corrompida política y socialmente. Todo esto converge con un sentimiento poderoso de humanidad a través de los ojos de un hombre solitario, dolido y quebrantado.Hay dos puntos que me gustaría resaltar, primero, esta cinta puede parecer pretenciosa para algunas personas, hay mucho diálogo de exposición que resaltan lo obvio, empero, hay momentos sin diálogo que, a través de la música, de la fantástica fotografía y de la magistral interpretación de Joaquin Phoenix, la audiencia puede apreciar la caída de Arthur y el nacimiento de su alter ego, el Joker. -la escena del baile en el baño es un claro ejemplo de lo anterior-. La crudeza de las imágenes, la violencia, y una clara crítica al sistema capitalista hacen de Joker una cinta compleja y para nada olvidable. Es bastante obvia la inspiración sacada del maestro Scorsese en sus cintas “Taxi Driver” y “El Rey de la Comedia” -ambas interpretadas por Robert De Niro que también aparece en esta cinta-. Segundo, ignoren la controversia sobre la tonta idea de que esta cinta incita a la sociedad a cometer actos ilícitos, los críticos solo analizan la forma pero ignoran el fondo, lo cual es triste pues esta película transmite valiosos, bestiales y poderosos mensajes que son de gran relevancia en la actualidad.… Expand",9,0,"Nov 24, 2019"

Unlike other comic book movies which are filled with CGI and animation, joker uses story over action.The movie is about arthur fleck (joaquin phoenix), a middle aged, miserable, poor standup comedian who suffers from mental problems and lives with his old mother.He lives in gotham city where the people are cruel, emotionless and awful. Arthur is lonely and helpless yet he tries to be a good human being by sending positive energy and trying to make the people laugh and smile but the others are so wicked, merciless, enraged and furious they don't even accept him and make him feel worse by bullying, beating and abandoning him. Imagine what happens when a victim of society runs out of patience and turns extremely evil. The atposphere of the film is quite dark and the pace of the movie is a little slow in the beginning but as we go forward in the story it goes faster and faster just like a roller coaster.The music and soundtracks used in the movie are perfectly in place and completely related to the theme of movie.The climacteric of the movie is joaquin phoenix's fabulous and oscar worthy acting , where he delivers the sense of the film in the best way possible.Joker might be one of the darkest movies made in decades but definitely deserves to be watched with patience and attention because it's one of the few movies that besides giving audience entertainment it tries to make people think.… Expand",10,0,"Nov 29, 2019"

Joaquim PhoenixThis movie is exactly what i wanted to a Joker movie, it's uncomfortable (in a good way), it's acid and it's shocking, all of this are not just things for the sake of ""impact"", it's exactly what a story about Joker should be. Joaquim Phoenix perfomance is phenomenal, it's the first time i saw someone laughing and crying at the same time, the way that you can feel the pain in his laughter it's truly mindblowing, here we see Arthur (his character) expressing all kinds of emotion, from anger to happinnes, from sorrow to confusion, and so on, the movie was made for him and we couldn't had a better Joker than Joaquim. The nods to old movies like: Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy (both of Scorsese) are really interesting and they never felt forced to me, it has everything to do with that whole ""character study"" that Joker masterfully achieves. That movie is like a rollercoaster, it's start kinda of slow but when the moment comes it has that habilty to make you feel on the edge of your seat. The story construction was pretty well made as well, it makes sense that the poor people are upset about the situation of the city, it makes sense that they see Joker as a symbol, this is not saying where they are right or wrong, it just brings the consequences of a sick society, the same circustamces that made a mentally-ill person at a dangerous psychopat who laughs of the tragedy he's been trough. For me it's a masterful example of how you should make a Origin story, that's why i think this movie is a instant classic and a masterpiece.It's a shame that a movie like Joker isn't get the praise that it deserves for the critics, that's why nobody cares about them anymore, people are much more interested to see opinions from guys the people who are up-voting this movie than a person that is much more concerned to try to put political agenda in his analisis instead of view the movie as a art.… Expand",10,11,"Oct  3, 2019"

It's a true modern day masterpiece that deserves all the praise it gets and none of the hate from naysayers. Phoenix gives a performance that rivals Ledger's and brings something never before seen to the comic book world. Todd Phillips has proven that he no longer needs the frat-boy comedies and that the world of dramas is where he thrives best. Lawrence Sharr, the man behind the cinematography, has brought to life some of the most gorgeous shots I have ever personally seen, even rivaling Roger Deakins from Blade Runner 2049. The score by Hildur is ecstatic and terrifying to listen to. I really love this movie, from its story -- while familiar -- fits within the world that has been established, to the acting FROM EVERYBODY, to the greater themes of bad days, society, and madness itself. It's sad to say that we will never get another look into the world of Joker because this movie left me wanting more, and that's a truly amazing thing for a movie to do. If it leaves you wanting more, then it did its job.

There’s nothing exciting about it – there’s only a modicum of violence (if you want violence in a much better movie, go see the latest Rambo).  And Phoenix doesn’t hold a candle to Heath Ledger’s Joker.  I mean, in that movie, there’s a palpable sense of dread throughout.  You could cut the tension with a knife.  This one?  It’s just there. Inert.  Tedious.  I checked my watch maybe 4 times, which is bad.  Whoever has been calling this movie “dangerous”, or a movie of its time…. Please.  I’d love to see a movie in which people so fed up over political talk all day and all night go out and cause mayhem.  There’s nothing remotely like that here.  And let me take a moment to call out DeNiro.  He’s entirely mis-cast.  What’s more, he totally mailed this performance in.  Maybe he saved his best (or even “good”) stuff for The Irishman. The only really good performance in this film is by the actress from Atlanta. Actually, Paperboy from Atlanta is also very good in a tiny role.  I was pumped up to see this – what a letdown.

CityOfGeek,"A longer version of this review appears on my site.If Todd Phillip’s Joker has anything going for it, it is an attempted down-to-earth take on super-villainy in a world we know will eventually be filled with spandex and superheroes, freeA longer version of this review appears on my site.If Todd Phillip’s Joker has anything going for it, it is an attempted down-to-earth take on super-villainy in a world we know will eventually be filled with spandex and superheroes, free from the constraints and expectations of comic book trappings. This trash-strewn Gotham City of 1981 invokes a dirty, grimier period of cinema and city. In that end, Lawrence Sher’s cinematography nails the feel of the films the movies desperately wants to emulate. It’s far away from the cheery and essentially light MCU  and it’s more dour than the much maligned other DC films, none of which really connect to Joker. This is fine. This is still Batman’s world, but not any version seen previously. In case you thought this stand on its own, there are many direct connections, all forced and inspiring everything from a “really” look to my eyes rolling hard.Joker aka Arthur Fleck has no power in life except accidentally starting a revolution with shooting three Yuppies in self-defense. Stripping away the theatricality of the Clown to attempt to present a story of that One Bad Day that made the villain is a refreshing take. But, It is rather unnecessary. It’s been said that Joker is what it would look like if Scorsese tried his hand at a comic-book movie. Joker is someone who saw Scorsese films, particularly Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy but doesn’t understand why they work. As Scorsese often does, Joker presents a villain as a hero in his own story. His heroes are often far from good people. That’s why we love to watch Travis Bickle or Jordan Belfort. We get into the head of someone we cannot truly identify with as they tell us their actions are justified. But we also know teye aren’t. They are kept an arm’s distance away, with a level of satire or social-commentary. However, Joker leaves out the satire, presenting Fleck as a direct protagonist: a man who cracks after being broken by the system. He’s had enough, and society must crumble.One feels we’re meant to follow his action as justified and ultimately the “hero” Gotham needs and deserves. There is a kernel of truth and reason mixed in. The system fails those who need it most. Fleck loses access to his medication and social worker when the social worker’s entire department is closed for budget cuts. We live in a world where people in need, whether it be from mental illness, addiction, or poverty. These people keep finding their support cut off, and society then get upset with bad things happen.This is lost in a mishmash of undercooked and misguided ideas. Fleck is a manifesto of the angry male loner. He works an underwhelming job as a party-clown. He lives with his mother in his forties. He desires the woman down the hall, but she barely knows his name – and considers him to be a threat. He’s told he creeps people out, and not to talk to their kids. He just can’t get a break. The whole world is against him, no one listens to him Everyone but his mother is the enemy. What’s worse, his actions are blamed on mental illness, directly stated in the climax, giving more backing to presenting the mentally ill as a threat rather than regular people.Phoenix is forced to try to make a compelling performance from this. He’s a fantastic actor who gives care to his roles. He’s saddled with a script that gives little. He surely gives an interesting performance in the same way Jack Nicholson does as Jack in The Shining. Both of these are starting at 11, already lost-causes, two seconds away from violence. There is no arc. Performance wise they can be moved around their films with no difference in how they are behaving.  The character’s an empty cipher meant for the viewer to pour into. For an origin story, there is precious little true backstory. A moment of abuse, a life-time of caring for his mother, and a mention of committal. Who is Fleck, really? Phillips doesn’t care. Joker is a tone-deaf film, providing either wrong-headed commentary directly or underdone ideas it feels are grander. Through all its pomp and anger and muddled messaging, Joker doesn’t work. It’s dull and repetitive, slogging on from one scene to another, powered by an awkward and on the nose script. Any time the hammer Phillips wields hits the nail, it is purely by accident. There are moments that almost work, where a glimmer of a good film shines through and where it almost feels poignant with something to actually say. But each time this occurs it’s soon lost in the weeds.… Expand",3,7,"Oct  3, 2019"

Acting across the board is fantastic; I can understand why Phoenix has been called out by some reviewers but for my mind the Joker is meant to be over acted and his slow descent into madness is perfectly executed.Overall this feels like the sort of film you end up studying in English class, there is a lot to take in and you will have questions come the end.

And that he’s accomplished, for better and for worse.  One of the criticisms of the film is that it’s a bit too much “Taxi Driver Goes to Gotham.”  Joker is in many ways an homage to those films. At the same time, Phillips hasn’t simply made a replica.  By setting this in the past, before Bruce Wayne has become Batman, Phillips has kept Gotham’s cartoonish bad guys out of this. Instead, we have a much more complex story, of a man who’s genuinely motivated to be as good as he knows how to be, and has that eroded in ways that we can see and understand.It’s easy enough to see him as a psychopath. But Fleck is a person who descends into his madness for reasons we can see and perhaps even understand. There’s another stream to this film. Fleck commits his act of savage violence while wearing his clown make-up. That oddity is interpreted as an act of rebellion by Gotham’s disenfranchised to wear clown masks in solidarity, and then commit acts increasingly violent civil disobedience.We are, of course in Gotham, not the real world. Gotham is a city that is a dystopian version of New York, and a version of humanity working at a heightened-reality level of antagonism and violence.And yet, in a time in our history where people feel deep divisions, the movie is perhaps a little too close to home for comfort.At the centre of the movie is Joaquin Phoenix, who won Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for this role. Phoenix is simply one of the best actors in contemporary film, with a staggering range. He’s an un-showy actor who does a deep dive into his characters, and unlike many Hollywood stars, he’s willing to take on roles that repulse.   In Joker, he disappears into Fleck and takes him from a dutiful son, to a confused man, to the psychopathic Joker character in a seamless arc. When he finally becomes Joker, Phoenix does a dance down a staircase, as if all burdens of the world have been lifted off of him. He has been released, and is embracing himself with a kind of joy that belongs to the damned. It’s a glorious performance and a terrifying moment in a film that revels in its dark heart.… Expand",10,3,"Oct  3, 2019"

Although I'd definitely mentionIt is exactly like a late night talk show, it is not for everyone, for not everyone can endear the experience, the pain and the laughs.JokerTodd Phillips is a magnificent beast. Who'd have thought of that. Although I'd definitely mention my theory that still stands tall and strong. If a director can make a comedy classic with proper execution then it can pull off any heist of any genres with his eyes closed. Take either Adam McKay or Peter Farelly and now join the co-writer and director Todd Phillips's name to that list. Todd's film is, yes, a recurrent display of what you want from this film. It can also be translated as his fandom of this character over the years, that he has finally brought alive. Either way, whenever the film lands our expectations. Good expectations. The film suffers a lot. The script grows tricky for me, whenever the gaps are filled in with what you and the general perception would perceive and the dots that you know are about to come, and have to be a part of this case until it reaches that crime scene.The film is only troubling in those senses. Another issue could be argued would be that the film doesn't clarify or give answers to all the existent and even questionable elements of the film. If it is an origin, then it should answer every corner of the truth. Should it? Should it, really though? For amidst this train of reckless actions, we forget that this is a comic book film. And just as any comic book story, you are told to believe in something and then move forward. Joker is in its truest form, with complete make up, dyed hair and colored suit, then becomes a comic book character. The consequences are to be determined. And not the reasons.Not the ""whys"", but the ""what now"". And this is why Joker is much more present then Arthur Fleck. When Fleck is lost, the mobile objects in the wide shots are going further and further away. And when Joker shines, those same objects, those same trains returns back home. Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck never looks for the surrounding or outside the vehicle he is in, for he has nothing, no one to look for. And Phoenix as Joker giddily drools over the catastrophe that his choices casts on Gotham city, a significance of his presence, existence. Joker is almost too aptly titled. For the film doesn't focus on any other character. You cannot blame that it is an excuse or justification with an emotionally manipulated track. You are empathetic towards him but that is only because he is the only one you have been with. His is the only appeal you have been hearing. The laugh you have been listening. The jokes you have been questioning. It doesn't matter whether you get it or not.… Expand",8,12,"Oct  3, 2019"

It's been SO LONG since I've seen a movie with QUALITY, something that makes you think, something that's different and as creative as this. Honestly... just when I was starting to lose faith in the movie industry this comes along and blows me away, it gave me that feeling of ""finally! A movie we've been desperately needing in the age of reboots and remakes and remasters and live cartoon adaptations and political correctness BS"" this is the direction the movie industry has to go and keep going. It's exactly what I personally always wanted as a Joker movie, a character study analysis about a broken man. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an award for his performance he killed it and honestly crushes all the previous Joker's that came before him that we've seen on screen and that's a huge statement. That laugh will send chills of disturbances down your spine every single time. It's a mix of sadness, confusion and just downright creepy I will even dare to say it's better than Mark Hamill's laugh. Make of that what you will. Acting? Superb!! Atmosphere and tone was perfect for this style of movie very depressing. Story? I won't spoil but it is very engaging, makes you think and you definitely feel for the Arthur. You'll be asking yourself questions even after the credits roll. No post credits by the way so don't sit through it. Music is a huge plus the composer really made the perfect soundtrack for such a film, she captures the mood and mentality of Arthur with every key note played a real treat. Loved it, I don't care what anyone says this is a 10/10 to me. If you love the Joker, or just a very good thriller about a broken man - watch this you won't regret it. Also - the snowflakes crying about wanting this banned because of violence? Ha... there was hardly any. I think other movies are worse in that regard, more drama than action if anything so no it won't promote a mass shooting or anything like that if anything it helps raise awareness on helping the mentally ill.

And I’m not referring to Arthur Fleck, -Todd Phillips’ latest incarnation of the Clown Prince of Crime – but the picture itself.As if the weight of 80 years in print or 5 decades on the screen weren’tJoker has problems. Pun intended. And I’m not referring to Arthur Fleck, -Todd Phillips’ latest incarnation of the Clown Prince of Crime – but the picture itself.As if the weight of 80 years in print or 5 decades on the screen weren’t oceanically crushing enough, we now are served another incarnation of an antagonist as ubiquitously immortal as Moriarty or Hannibal Lecter. What more can be said? Is there any meat left on the bones of the mythology?If one were to believe the marketing, we’re going to see a Taxi Driver meets The King of Comedy meets The French Connection. Sounds great, right? It would be, but it was marketing.What Joker does deliver is a thin screed on mental illness in an even sicker society. This society in decline has sensibilities contemporary to our own, despite the trappings of the 1970’s which seem like an aesthetic afterthought. Those versed in Batlore are presented Warner Brothers intellectual property anchors to orient themselves in the expanding cinematic graphic novel universe, but they are halfhearted name dropping at best. Trappings.At the heart of Joker is Arthur Fleck – ironically named. Joaquin Phoenix is masterful, more charming and sad than haunting. Despite his valiant energies, he’s not given much with which to work. Often times, he’s left to his own devices to soft shoe it to bridge scenes. No joke – Phoenix does quite a bit of improvisational dancing in Joker. Phillips and Scott Silver’s script give Phoenix very little to do other than riff on a psychological tick for two hours.Arthur Fleck is a mental illness cliche. Abused, medicated and neurotic. There is no arc for Fleck. Fleck lurches from one unfortunate circumstance to another. There’s no growth, no descent into madness – just an already poor, disturbed, delusional Arthur. We are never given any reason to empathize with Fleck. An excellent counterpoint to this character is another Phoenix played, Theodore Twombly in Spike Jonze’s superior Her (2013). Twombly is equally marginalized like Fleck, but Jonze and Phoenix give us little glimpses of the character’s humanity in the midst of his existential horror. We never get those in Joker. We, like Arthur, receive unsatisfactory reveals with epic portent and paltry emotional punch.Joker also lacks unifying tonal elements. Phillips can’t seem to decide if Joker is a moody, introspective independent character study or if it wants to wax epic. A solo cello pervades throughout the score, but at key moments Hildur Guðnadóttir seems to dial it up to full Zimmer. The production design is as anachronistic and as disjointed as the score. Everything feels dressed up, the elements are there but the mise-en-scène is missing. This world is too much our own. Joker is one of those rare pictures where the sum of its parts don’t equal the whole. I couldn’t help but think, why wasn’t it shot on film stock using vintage lenses? Though there is not much CGI, Joker is very crisp, very digital and that works against it.One thing that does work is the vintage music. One can imagine the creative possibilities of what wanted to be a lyrical, musical picture edited around classic songs. That was a glaringly missed opportunity.Zazie Beetz is all but an afterthought in this picture, a wasted talent and a virtual plot device.Phillips’ Coup de Gras in this disjointed ramble through mental illness mythology is an equally disjointed monologue at the end. I’ll not spoil it, but it’s a cheap, self conscious, point blank expository shot at society. There’s no teeth to it, it’s not menacing at all.   It’s banal and abrupt.  For those that wish or worry that this film will be the Anarchist, Alt-Right or Incel manifesto … don’t. This film just isn’t that smart or that creative. There’s a denouement, but there’s not much to it other than cinematic padding.If you pay close attention, you’ll see little homages to The King of Comedy, The Dark Knight, Psycho and Network. They’re not egregiously plagiaristic, just flair for the sake of flair. The Era of Easter Eggs needs to end.On the up side, the 20 minutes of trailers prior to Joker was exciting. A breath of fresh, serious cinematic air after a long hot Summer of Spandex.On a scale of 5, I give Joker a 2.75 and charitably round it up to 3.I’d wait for a $2.99 Amazon Prime rental for this one, folks. Hell, maybe just wait for Netflix.As old blue eyed Sinatra said, That’s Life.… Expand",6,1,"Oct  4, 2019"

Problems with unevenDespite a mostly solid (though occasionally hammy) performance by Joaquin Phoenix and an excellent production design, this much-awaited origin story about Batman's vile nemesis falls short on a number of other levels. Problems with uneven pacing, mishandled back story revelations, heavy-handed sociopolitical allegories, excessive narrative elements, violence bordering on gratuitous and plot holes aplenty all conspire to weaken an otherwise-ambitious story aimed at taking the comic book genre in a new direction. What's more, the film features an ending that's out of place compared to the apparent climax that preceded it. And then there are derivative elements taken almost verbatim from a variety of other pictures, including ""Falling Down,"" ""Network"" and ""The King of Comedy,"" among others. But what's perhaps most distressing is the message the film sends, one that's dangerous, even if accurate in its depiction of the state of affairs in the US today.

Get away, I don't know any joker""This scene would have illustrated the nature of jokes.The movie completely falls apart in the 78th act. ""Joker"" begins as a mild mannered man, but he ends as a medium tangy spicy mannered man. This was my favorite part of the movie -- the spice is just what I needed to spice up my life. That's when I made a realization -- am *I* the jokers? Let me explain...On the surface, ""Joker"" seems like it's just a movie about the difficulties of clown. However, when you delve a little deeper, you'll realize that the movie theater seats are not comfortable and the arm rests do not raise. Most of the seats cannot even hold a large drink, so why even sell them in that theater?Okay so now lets get to the negative part of the review. At exactly 1 hour and 38 minutes into the film, you can clearly see a baby smoking in the bottom right part of the screen. That's when I draw the line. A baby smoking? I then look over at my 38 year old baby and I see he picked up this trait from the movie. I don't want to spoil anything but I don't like the fact that he died at the end. Not even in a cool way. Dude just trips. Now if he tripped on a banana, then I would understand the joke. But now I sit here in my **** dimmly lit 400 sq ft apartment with my two kids and I am still trying to figure out what the joke was of this movie. Overall I think this movie is 10/10.

A harsh and obscure statement but it's not away from reality.For comic book readers this film can be considered as a story of the disappeared Elseworlds label or the new DC Black Label. However, there's something that bothers me a lot about it and that is that Joker itself has nothing of the Joker.Although the film seems to take certain inspirations from the character's stories, especially The Killing Joke, in a way, an essential way, Todd Phillips created the story of a mentally ill person and disguised him as the Joker and that's a problem because although it addresses a different perspective of the character's beginnings, in reality the Joker, the image itself is just a simple collateral element of the film's character's job.The clown means nothing, not even in the political and social context that the director tried to give to his story.The clown is only the chosen costume. It could have been something else but that ultimately wouldn't have been the Joker and believe me when I tell you that a film about a mentally ill person with murderous tendencies is much more commercial when you sell it as a famous character, than if you had only made a film about a mentally ill person with murderous tendencies.Unfortunately Joker is an interesting story of misery and rot but unable to be more provocative and frankly the story is barely enough to compensate for the entire film. It's the performance of Joaquin Phoenix that sustains it.Todd Phillips makes clear how limited he is as a filmmaker because he never achieves a memorable or spectacular scene, he just drives the story while letting Phoenix do his job. No one else in the cast is relevant, not even De Niro, they're just people around Arthur Fleck and his mental descent which reaches its breaking point in that violent final stretch but unfortunately never feels like the Joker, or at least the Joker who has always been known.Joker isn't a bad film at all but I don't see nothing great either.It's a different perspective and a different approach to comic book adaptations and shows that contrasting takes can be made with such stories and characters and for me that's a good thing.And personally despite the good work of Phoenix and although the comparison might be unfair, Heath Ledger's performance remains unrivaled.… Expand",6,0,"Oct  4, 2019"

I'm definitely burnt out on origin stories lately, and furthermore, I've always liked Joaquin Phoenix as an actor, but I wasn't too sure if he'd have what it takes to get this iconic role just right, something only 'The Dark Knight's' Heath Ledger has managed to do so far in my opinion. After seeing this... I can confidently say that I really could've done without this film. I found myself thoroughly unimpressed with just about every scene, moment, etc. The entire film felt sleazy to a fault, seeming content to wallow in its own filth and misery. In addition, the film definitely seemed like it was short on ideas, which would explain why half the film seemingly consisted of scenes of Phoenix doing nothing but dancing, laughing manically, and acting like a fool. It really felt like nothing more than an excuse for him to act like his usual weird self for two long hours. For those hoping that he'd live up to the hype that he supposedly surpasses Ledger's performance as the Joker, in my eyes, it's no contest. Ledger is still far and out the superior performance. I could tell Phoenix was having fun with his take on the character, but that's about it.

The moments that gave me chills were the scene when Arthur is holding little Bruce's face and then when he is in the stairwell with his mother's medical chart and verifies everything Tom Wayne told me was true about his mother. Learning everything he thought he knew was a lie and the anger that grew within him that bought him to such disillusionment with his world it made him kill the one person he most loved in his world and turn him into the psychopathic killer. Her death killed Arthur Fleck and reincarnated him into the Joker. The twist with Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz ) was brilliant and totally unexpected.Wow. This film was like a Greek Tragedy play. This is the film I wish all other comic book movies were modeled after. Nothing is over the top, everything is plausible in this realistic world. No super powers or grandiose schemes. Arthur Fleck is just a regular man like the Waynes, but without the fortunes of the Waynes. Just a man who beleaguered with abuse, lies, manipulation and misfortune that snaps into the killer he becomes.I did not want the movie to end because I loved it so much. My bladder was at the point of bursting but I did not want to leave my seat and miss a thing. This is a titanium scribed A++.

KeithDow,"Before any of us see a single frame of Todd Phillips’ ‘Joker’ we’re all well aware of the film’s many plaudits and longtime critical acclaim.  Even prior articles of our own have covered the fact that ‘Joker’ received an eight minute standingBefore any of us see a single frame of Todd Phillips’ ‘Joker’ we’re all well aware of the film’s many plaudits and longtime critical acclaim.  Even prior articles of our own have covered the fact that ‘Joker’ received an eight minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival, or that it also took home the Golden Lion, the festival’s award for best film.Based on the competition, such illustrious awards may very well be warranted, but over time, reaction to ‘Joker’ seemed to falter, starting with the movie losing out to Taika Waititi’s 'Jojo Rabbit' at the Toronto International Film Festival.  Even now, ‘Joker’ is only garnering a 69% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 58 on Metacritic.  Frankly, we don’t disagree.For as much as we appreciate the grittiness and stripped-down nature of the film, which represents a welcomed departure from the typical superhero/supervillain genre (or action genre in general), the film simply has too many flaws to earn our outright acclaim.For example, a lot of the gratuitous violence just doesn’t feel organic.  Instead, it feels like Phillips knew he needed to show some gruesomeness—or perhaps he just wanted to ramp up the shock factor—so he wedged a few bloody scenes into the script.  Worse, a lot of the scenes were shot using a heavy filter, which to us made it feel like we we watching a movie-within-a-movie, which itself provided an emotional filter distancing us from the story unfolding on screen.Lastly, leading up to this weekend, plenty of people have made comparisons between ‘Joker’ and Martin Scorsese’s ‘Taxi Driver.’  Sure, Todd Phillips borrows a lot of imagery from the classic, especially the handgun gesture Arthur Fleck uses all too often.  But if the same people are comparing the two in terms of quality and merit, they are severely overselling ‘Joker,’ severely underselling ‘Taxi Driver,’ or both.… Expand",7,3,"Oct  4, 2019"

The3AcademySins,"Having seen Joker a second time, I can confirm that this movie is a character study filled with strong performances that drip off of the screen. Throughout most of the movie, I forgot I was watching a comic book movie. Make no mistake, thisHaving seen Joker a second time, I can confirm that this movie is a character study filled with strong performances that drip off of the screen. Throughout most of the movie, I forgot I was watching a comic book movie. Make no mistake, this is an incredibly timely, hard hitting drama that has a lot to say without being overly political.To address the controversy surrounding this film: this movie is not a glorification of incel culture at all. To make that claim is disingenuous at best. I find it hard to believe that anyone would walk out of this movie and think that Arthur Fleck is a hero. However, the movie dares you to feel empathy for him, and I definitely did. Joker really paints a bleak picture of a society that treats the suffering, mentally ill poor like garbage, and then shows apathy when violence does break out.On that note, the violence in this film is not overly gorey, but it is extremely realistic, and this is not a movie for the faint of heart. In addition to the very real violence, this movie is a story of a deeply disturbed man who has an increasingly more terrifying psychotic breakdown over the film's two hour runtime. Joaquin Phoenix is terrifying to behold, and he gives one of the best performances I have seen all year. People will not soon forget his scary performance, and I think he will stand proudly beside the likes of Heath Ledger and Mark Hamill when it comes to great Jokers.As far as the script, it's pretty darn good. It weaves a nuanced, complex argument about mental illness and classism. This story dares the audience to examine their own treatment of the mentally ill in their lives, and whether or not we really care about them. This movie is brave enough to ask whether our societal apathy is responsible for people going off the deep end and committing gruesome crimes. From a cinematography stand point, the camera work and shot structure is hideously immaculate. It constructs a really dirty, scummy underbelly of a city with striking beauty.The soundtrack is great. The music always comes from the world of the movie, and the use of Frank Sinatra is just terrifying to hear. It's very inventive, and I enjoyed pretty much the entire score.My only two qualms with the movie are that it is a very, very on-the-nose take on Taxi Driver, and that it is a slow burn.

This movie is an absolutely fantastic character study, and anybody who thinks it's confused about the plot is trying to watch a different movie altogether. Joaquin Phoenix pulls off an incredible portrayal of the Joker, one that is at once faithful to the character and yet as unique in its way as Ledger's was. If I'm being nit-picky, I have issues with the one scene where Joker pontificates towards the end, it seemed superfluous and slightly discordant, but takes away nothing from the massive accomplishment that this movie represents. It's deeply indebted to Alan Moore for this versio of the Joker's origin, and viewers should always remember that there is no 'definitive' Joker, or at least that question won't be settled until DC releases The Three Jokers! In straying away from the DCU, both in style and in substance, this movie is easily one of the best DC-based movies you'll watch this decade.… Expand",9,6,"Oct  4, 2019"

An amazing adaptation of several Joker origin stories overlayed with other other works in film history. This doesn't make the move any less creative. Movies like avatar have had stories that are old and have been told numerous times, but it's how they present them that makes them stand out. Joker is no different. Filled with social undertones related to current times, Joker takes what was old and makes it new again in brilliant ways.Some of ""professional"" reviews are missing the point and even outright lying about it. Saying it has no batman in it, is disingenuous at best. You could argue that this is a prequel to the Dark Knight series, with the same amounts of darkness and even more realism. On the surface, it is about anarchy. Did you expect something different? Do you know Joker? Below the surface are undertones about inequality, social duties, and freedoms that we're allowed and our inhumanity in daily life.To all the people saying that Joker is glorified and the movie sets him up as hero, you're just wrong. No one sees him as a hero. Understanding why someone does something, doesn't mean you agree with it. Saying a kid has mental issues as a reason he shoots up a school, doesn't mean you agree with it. You just understand it. Joker here is no different. Overall a great movie and something I will watch several times, even before it hits other formats. Personally, I believe everyone needs to watch it, regardless of whether you agree with it or not. It contains messages that need to be said/heard.… Expand",10,3,"Oct  4, 2019"

I don't think that since The Rocky Horror Picture Show's sequel Shock Treatment that I've had such a conflict over how I feel about aThe Joker is a stand-alone film outside the DC Universe which is an origin story for the Batman villain. I don't think that since The Rocky Horror Picture Show's sequel Shock Treatment that I've had such a conflict over how I feel about a film. I think I equally like and dislike this movie.First off, I'll confirm most of the good things that everyone's been saying: This has some very interesting looks at wealth inequality, the failings of mental health care, what can cause the result of psychopathic attacks, and the basic human apathy and failure of humankid to take care of itself in general. There are a lot of really top notch lines and scenes in this. The final act is something. It leaves quite the impression.The whole things looks great. Director Todd Phillips provides such an impressive look and sound to the film. Some great cinematography. Dirty, crowded, crime-laden Gotham looks great. Both score and song selections really guide the mood.Again I must parrot what everyone's saying: Joaquin Phoenix delivers what could be an Oscar-winning performance as the lead. He is so nuanced and excels at making you feel uncomfortable. Joaquin has such a unique body language in this. This version of the Joker has a condition where he can laugh uncontrollably, and the actor does a great job of making it feel realistic and unpleasant. He also appears to have lost a lot of weight in this. The Joker is traditionally portrayed as a skinny feller but here the movie uses this to make the character feel at times downright primal or sickly, matching his mental state.However, the movie should not have been two hours long. In order to show the events that create the Joker, Phillips over-compensates and throws way too many plot points at the guy. There are moments that are quite tedious, especially in the middle. There is a also a subplot I was really not found of that reeks of uninspired fan-fiction.To be honest, this was such a grounded piece by superhero comic standards that it could've been a non-comic book film. Yeah, DC is trying to show that these films can be more prestigious and serious, but by taking out the over-the-top parts of the superhero genre, I feel we may lose what made them special in the first place.This is the first real comic supervillain movie. (Venom's movie was an anti-hero flick.) But taking the comics into account: his isn't the first attempt to redo a supervillain's origina story. I feat that a lot of these stories frustratingly tend to recycle concepts and this is no exception. These include: 1) Make the villain's story darker than previous incarnations. 2) Have one of their few connections be with a mother and/or romantic interest or fixation (Zazie Beets' character could've been cut out of this completely without changing anything).Considering that this is about a burgeoning psychopath, you can probably guess, but just to confirm: this is a REALLy dark movie. Violence doesn't happen all the time but when it does: Whoo-boy! Phillips has publicly mentioned that the films of Scorses, such as Taxi Driver and The Comedian, greatly influenced him. So, be forewarned if that's not your thing.I really had a hard time deciding on the rating for this. On one hand, Phillips, who has directed comedies up till now, surprisingly pulls off quite a confident, intriguing cinematic experience. The movie managed to elicit an emotional response from me that very few films have. However, the issues I mentioned prevented me from loving this or watching a second time. Some of the theater audience at the end clapped, but I personally don't think the movie was strong enough to justify that.… Expand",7,0,"Oct  4, 2019"

At this point I think it’sFirst of all, the message in this film is great especially with what’s going on in the world. Everybody who goes to see this movie will probably walk away thinking the exact same thing and know what the message is. At this point I think it’s pretty obvious what everybody already knows and I’m just going to put in my five cents and that’s Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as Arthur Fleck/Joker and he definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for his role. He went all-in with this character showing the different stages in his life and making everybody feel bad for him. At certain points in the film, I felt really bad for the guy and wanted to help him out because nobody deserves to be treated that way. It also helps that he didn’t start out as wanting to become the Joker but society just helped turn him into him. Robert De Niro, who plays Murray Franklin, probably won’t get an Oscar nomination for supporting actor but he still did a standout job with his character. Another thing that stood out to me was the cinematography of the movie and how it helped show Arthur’s slow descent into madness and how he views the world. I feel like some people are waiting for me to hate on the pacing of this film and honestly, I had no problem with it at all. If the movie was any longer it would have felt like it was dragging on and any shorter and they would have rushed the Joker transformation. But with that in mind, this film is like most people have said already and that’s a character story. So, if you don’t want to watch a story about a man who’s driven to his breaking point and wants to see an action superhero then stay home and watch The Dark Knight. I love how the costume was different from any Joker suit we’ve seen before, though it’s hard to replicate without buying a store-bought costume. The music by Hildur Guonadottir was amazing.

Despite being predictably difficult to watch, this was a very clever take on the Joker as a character (and make no mistake, he is a CHARACTER in this film).

There was a hell of a lot more substance to this than I expected. This was a masterful slow burning character study, showing the transformation of a downtrodden, mentally ill sociopath, into The Joker. And yeah, it’s one of the darkest and most uncomfortable comedies you will ever see but it’s set up and done very well. Visually great, soundtrack great and Phoenix was unbelievable. This is getting a lot of bad reviews from critics who I guess were made uncomfortable but there are thousands of senselessly violent movies and this was dark as you get, but not senseless.

Do you want to see just how bad someone has to have it that it brings him joy to watch the world burn? This is your film. And there lies my personal problem with the film. It does this so well, that I genuinely felt disturbed watching it. Many of the scenes get real, and you might find yourself seeing people you know, or even yourself, in the Joker. I walked out of the theater just flat out uncomfortable, and a bit depressed. I recommend this movie to anyone looking to explore the things that can make one so miraculously cynical. The film does a phenomenal job looking into those themes. Just don't expect to have a good time watching it.… Expand",10,2,"Oct  4, 2019"

I thought this looked solid at best and even a bit too pretentious in the trailer, but in here to say I was incredibly wrong. This is a massive achievement of cinema that's extremely rare in a day and age of cgi nonsense and reboots. While this is somewhat of a reboot of sorts, the standalone origin tale is impeccable from start to finish and echoes resemblance to the best joker origin comics from the past. Joaquin bleeds, sweats, and cries his every drop into this magnificently dedicated performance. Heath Ledger would be proud. This is undoubtedly the greatest acting performance since Heath's joker. The directing and writing is slickly brilliant and the bleak settings and tones are palpable throughout.

Joker in every essence is a masterpiece. Like every scene is a part of a jigsaw puzzle and all the pieces fall right into place, Todd has made sure you see it happening. To talk about Joaquin Phoenix as a comic book fan I think the biggest compliment I can give him is that he's finally a joker worthy enough to be compared to the great Mark Hamill, his laugh Haunts you, he manages to express his laughs in all situations and you feel it. I'd be lying if I said it didn't give me chills. The last time something like this happened was when I saw Batman, Mask of Phantasm. Joaquin's acting is top notch and this is the first movie I've seen of his, and I'm gonna zip through his other movies soon. The point of this movie is that it is gripping and it manages to hold its viewers, let it be through Todd's vision, Joaquin's acting or the music. It has all the right elements mixed precisely, and it makes you one with the character, I for once couldn't stop myself from dancing in my seat because the music is great and Joaquin is magnetic. If you love dark humour you will love this movie, if you don't like Joker states ""you wouldn't get it"". Comic book fans would know Joker does not have an origin story and they could have done anything with the storyline. They could have picked anything as a story, but they picked magnificence. As a comic book fan I had huge expectations and Honestly it has exceeded my expectations. My rant won't make any sense because this work of art cannot be described in words. You will have to go experience it, live it, feel the emotions and for once just once become one with a character.

Joker is a cinematic masterpiece, while the first 20 minutes may feel like they drag on a bit, the film more than makes up for it in the third act. Joaquin Phoenix plays the joker perfectly making it so that no one to relate to him, but in the same way having everyone be able to relate to him. The end of the film is brutal with joker killing the television host live on air in a way only the joker can, as a joke. Furthermore while everyone saw it coming, including Thomas and Martha Wayne's now infamous death outside the theatre now inexplicably links the joker to Bruce Wayne throughout his ride as the bat, now becoming part of his origin as well. This movie is easily a 10/10 with no joker apart from ledger's being able to beat it. Joaquin does Heath Ledger proud.… Expand",10,4,"Oct  4, 2019"

Every scene is excellent thanks to Joaquin Phoenix's incredible performance. He really sells the role, at points, I was even convinced he was not acting, that he really was like this in real life. That's how incredible he is in this film. Throughout the film, inescapable anxiety surrounds every scene. It feels as if Joker will crack at any moment, like a pipe with too much pressure. That constant feeling of unease was what sold the movie for me. In the end, I feel empathy for the Joker, and I think that's what the audience is meant to feel, the movie has been written like that.

So don't expect an action-packed movie, but a slow ""character growth"" (more likely regress) movie, but one that is surprisingly well-paced most of the time to not get boring.Joachim's performance is amazing, to a point in the movie where the character becomes more self-absorbed and confident and you can almost say it's a different actor playing the role. I've heard some calling his acting exaggerated, it's certally not, at least not in the majority of scenes. (the movie does a subtles, yet kinda smart trick where some scenes are from the main characters' POV and not the actual real POV of all the other characters; this is done with a subtle reveal near the climax of the movie)It's a gritty depressing movie, but there are a lot darker, violent and depressing titles than this one, to a point I'm starting to believe American media has a serious problem by calling this movie controversial. There's nothing controversial about this one, the Joker is not glorified nor blamed, he is just shown as he is (as a good movie should do), the movie does not force a point of view letting the viewer draw a conclusion (as a good movie should do).The directing and cinematography are very good.

It’s not spoiled here.At the end of the movie, I still vaguely remember what Arthur said. ""Please...don’t...i really love my job..."" Writing this eyelids began to turn red again. It is not difficult to imagine how much a person will be disappointed when he simply wants to bring laughter to the world, but is ridiculed and used by the world. You really can go see ""Joker"" After reading it, I just want to talk to everyone around me. Don't be indifferent to the people around you. Even if he is sick, he is very strange, and don't abandon him. Because you may be able to save it before the world changes. I don't want to talk too much here, because I know that film reviews or experiences will affect the shock and the point of entry for a person. If you see something else or have any feelings, go to the movies and taste! I just want to say after reading it.

And that is where the movie shines; everything related to Arthur is pretty good but once he slowly starts turning into the Joker it starts falling apart.The attempt to ground this movie in the Gotham mythos is what keeps it from being anything else than an above average one as there are many inconsistencies with the source material, rangig from the superficial, like the age difference between Bruce and the Arthur(judging by the timeline of the movie, the Joker will walk with a cane by the time Bruce starts kicking ass), to more profound ones, like the fact that this Joker doesn't really resemble the Clown Prince of Crime. I know this is only his origin story, but even so he feels kind of dumb and at the end you are left feeling rather sorry for him than afraid.Now, what most feel is the highlight of the film is Joaquin's performance, but I wasn't very impressed by it. It isn't bad, in fact it's quite good, but every time I look at him I can see it's an actor playing a role instead of an actual person. I think a more subtle approach would have been better since I haven't watched anyone be so desperate for an Oscar since that time DiCaprio crawled naked from an animal carcass. What really stands out in the movie however is its world. It's dark, it's gritty, and not in a Zack Snyder stlized way, rather here filth looks like filth, everything seems old and decayed and enhances the feeling of a world fallen to despair, where madness breeds more madness, so props to the director and cinematographer.All in all, a pretty good movie. Not only in the Comic book genre, but in general. I would have given it a 6, but since it triggers snowflakes and Disney shills it deserves one extra point. And maybe an extra rewatch.… Expand",7,5,"Oct  4, 2019"

It’s everything you’ve heard it would be and more. DC descended into a pit of bad movies in recent years, frantically searching for a balance between dark and gritty or laugh out loud comedies. So not only is it refreshing to see a successful, well-written, stripped back comic book movie but it’s also one of the darkest films I’ve seen in years and definitely pushes the comic book genre into new territory.Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a man who has been forgotten by society, neglected and living in poverty with his mother in Gotham. Working as a clown for hire and desperately trying to make it as a stand-up comedian. A character study very much grounded in reality. It may be too real or too dark for some viewers, watch the trailer if you’re in any doubt, it will give you just a taste of what’s in store if you decide to see Joker.There was always going to be the problem of taking on an iconic character like the Joker on the big screen again. Anyone portraying that role can’t help but be stuck in the shadow of Heath Ledger’s performance. A performance so brilliant the Oscars decided it was deserving of a win. The abysmal Suicide Squad gave us a very different take on the Joker with Jared Leto. Hardly a memorable performance though in his defence he didn’t exactly get a fair shot as Suicide Squad appeared to be hacked to pieces in the editing room and stitched back together at random. That is the only logical conclusion I can draw from one of the worst comic book films I’ve ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix was an ideal casting choice for a Joker origin movie, it’s not an over the top CGI flashy film by any means. Phoenix is one of those few actors that puts everything into a role, you can see him disappear and transform into the Joker. It’s terrifyingly brilliant and I’ll be shocked if he doesn’t walk away with an Oscar for his portrayal as the Joker. He’s one of the only actors who could possibly match Heath Ledger’s standard. Just don’t ask me to choose a favourite because there’s no way I could do that.Everything from Joaquin Phoenix’s onscreen presence to the chilling soundtrack sets out to unsettle you constantly. I was incredibly tense for this whole film and I know I’ll still be thinking about Joker for a long time afterwards. A deep look into the mind of a man pushed beyond his limits. Phoenix’s manic laugh alone is enough to send chills down your spine. Frightening, disturbing and at times it’s almost like a horror movie. It doesn’t matter what kind of comic book movie you prefer Joker is recommended for all you film fans.… Expand",10,4,"Oct  4, 2019"

Joker is a fantastic film and a fantastic comic book film. Although the film is great, there are a small handful of issues. Unfortunately, most of those issues are spoiler related so I can’t talk about them. The one I can talk about is that the film does sometimes borrow a little too much from the films it is inspired by, Taxi Driver (1976) and The King of Comedy (1983). If you have seen either of those films and watch Joker then you will know what I am talking about. Other than that and my spoiler related issues, the film is almost perfect. Joaquin Phoenix does a phenomenal job as the Joker. You can barely recognize that it is him because he just disappears into this role. The way Joaquin Phoenix shows this slow downfall of his character is incredible. Robert De Niro also does a fantastic job with his limited role. He’s cold, calculating, and manipulative and it’s perfect. The sequence of events that the film portrays is perfect. It doesn’t quickly get to the “Joker” but spends most of the film showing the slow downfall of his character. The film does this to perfection. This film is incredibly dark. There are multiple moments in the film that your jaw just drops at what happens. The film uses violence to its advantage. The scenes where it is used in adds to the already huge amount of tension that has been built up which leads me to my next point, Joker is incredibly tense. There are multiple moments where events are slowly building up and you are just on the edge of your seat waiting for the climax of that scene and when it happens, it feels super satisfying. The score for this film is amazing also. Hildur Guðnadóttir has so many outstanding compositions that adds to the tension and gives us an insight into Arthur’s mind. The cinematography is surprisingly really good. It always provides a way to show us how Arthur is feeling while also getting other necessary shots. Joker is a film that has to be experienced on its own. Ignore the controversy behind it and try not to pay too much attention to the critic reviews. You have to see the film and depending on how you feel the film portrays issues like violence and mental illness will determine if you like it or not. Overall, Joker is exactly what comic book films needed with a breathtaking performance from Joaquin Phoenix and an interesting, dark, and realistic approach  into an iconic character. I give Joker a 9.5/10.… Expand",9,5,"Oct  5, 2019"

But these lists are so useless like the lists of best wine, pizzas, ... it's all up to your liking.Yes the joker performance of Ledger puts you on the edge of your seat - but so do Phoenix's - but for different reasons. People forget that this is a Joker movie, not a Batman movie. Such a bitter sweet Joker origin story simply didn't exist. The lonliness, the frustration just everything is so well played you can feel it deep inside your guts. And it's the first time EVER you really sympathize with and care about the character out of compassion rather then just because the joker is a ""cool"" character like in all the other performances. But again, that's because it's a joker movie while all the others are batman movies. Joaquin Phoenix's Performance is just outstanding.

If[ENGLISH]Since childhood, Joker has always been my favorite character, and everyone knows it. I don't know why, but, since I saw an image of Jack Nicholson as Joker, I loved it, and, that was the beginning of my love for the character. If I'm sad, I see anything about Joker, and it makes me happy... He it conveys many emotions to me.At first, I didn't like the idea of a Joker movie without Batman.I also thought that it would be a good movie, yes, but of a man who calls himself Joker, without being.On top of that, villain films are not usually the way I would like them, posing them as antiheroes or even heroes.However, with the last thing I was seeing, my hopes with this movie were rising, and finally, after seeing it, I can say that I am lucky to have Joker as my favorite character.His transfer to the cinema has been fantastic in most cases, leaving a mark on popular culture. And, I think Joaquin Phoenix is going to do it too.From the first conversation to the end, I have been seeing the Joker character.It seems incredible to me how Phoenix laughs, and suffers at the same time, throughout the whole movie. Simply incredible. I have no discrepancy with the issue that Phoenix deserves the Oscar for best actor.Any cinematographic element (the script, the rhythm, the direction, the photography, etc…), is wonderful.The film has managed to do one of the things that seem most important to me in any medium, and, what the character always causes me: Feel emotions.I have released tears, i have laughed, I have been moved (smiling uncontrollably like Joker), but, above all, I have suffered.The whole movie has kept me in complete tension, even more, that any horror movie.Besides, music helps in that, it's fantastic, and I love her, it wouldn't be the same without her.Without being exaggerated, violence impacts a lot, due to the construction of its scenes.The negative point that was going to criticize, disappears during the movie.The pace of the movie is great, and it leaves you wanting more. I wish I could see more of this Joker…I highly recommend it, if you are a fan of the character, and of the cinema. Though, I think it is not suitable for sensitive people.This is not a crazy clown movie, this, is Joker.[ESPAÑOL]Desde pequeño, Joker siempre ha sido mi personaje favorito, y todo el mundo lo sabe. No sé por qué, pero, desde que vi una imagen de Jack Nicholson como Joker, me encantó, y, ese fue el inicio de mi amor por el personaje. Si estoy triste, veo cualquier cosa de Joker, y me hace feliz... Me trasmite muchas emociones.En un principio, no me gustaba la idea de una película de Joker sin Batman. También pensaba, que sería una buena película, sí, pero de un señor que se hace llamar Joker, sin serlo. Encima, las películas de villanos no suelen ser como me gustaría, planteándolos como antihéroes o incluso, héroes (Por ejemplo, Maléfica o Venom, que de villanos tienen poco en sus películas…).Sin embargo, con lo último que estaba viendo, mis esperanzas con esta película iban en aumento, y finalmente, tras verla, puedo decir, que soy un suertudo al tener a Joker como mi personaje favorito. Su traslado al cine ha sido fantástico en la mayoría de los casos, dejando huella en la cultura popular. Y, creo que Joaquin Phoenix va a hacerlo también.Desde la primera conversación hasta el final, he estado viendo al personaje de Joker.Me parece increíble como Phoenix ríe, y sufre al mismo tiempo, durante toda la cinta. Simplemente, increíble. No tengo ninguna discrepancia con el tema de que Phoenix se merezca el Oscar al mejor actor.Cualquier elemento cinematográfico (El guion, el ritmo, la dirección, la fotografía, etc…), son maravillosos.La película ha logrado hacer una de las cosas que me parecen más importantes en cualquier medio, y, lo que el personaje siempre me provoca: Sentir emociones. He soltado lágrimas, me he reído, me he inquietado, me he emocionado (sonriendo incontrolablemente como Joker), pero, sobre todo, he sufrido. Toda la película me ha mantenido en completa tensión (no estoy exagerando), incluso más, que cualquier película de terror.Además, la música ayuda en ello, pues, es fantástica, y la amo, no sería lo mismo sin ella.Sin ser exagerada, la violencia impacta mucho por la construcción de sus escenas.El punto negativo que le iba a criticar, desaparece durante la película…El ritmo de la película es genial, y, te deja con ganas de más. Ojalá pudiera ver más de este Joker… Cuando percibía que estaba a punto de terminar, pensaba: ¡No termines, por favor, quiero más!La recomiendo muchísimo, sobre todo, si eres fan del personaje, y del cine. Eso sí, creo que no es apta para la gente sensible.Esto, no es una película de un payaso loco, esto, es Joker.… Expand",10,2,"Oct  5, 2019"

The movie does a great job as a cautionary tale on the dangers of the epidemic of mental illness of our time and of the urgent need to shed a new light on it. It has the audience questioning the unnecessary inequalities that surround us and the imperstive need to reflect deeply on the social movements that promise change from a place of resentment. While Joker tumbles between reality and fantasy he’s at times frightening, seductive, pathetic, repulsive and endearing. He’s so right at questioning the sanity of a world that has him completely disenfranchised that I found myself rooting for him to get justice although I could never condone his violence. He just deserves to see that world go up in flames, and the world definitely deserves this son for no one could deny that he has come from its loins.… Expand",7,0,"Oct  5, 2019"

Aside from being masterfully shot, edited, acted and directed, the film is dangerous for all the right reasons. It casts a revealing light against us as a society in 2019 - how we treat each other, brush anything we don’t like or aren’t prepared to deal with under the carpet and most of all how the media and social elites tell us what to think, who to idolise, what we can or can’t like or find funny. The socio-political commentary took me completely by surprise in what is also a fantastic character study of a poor, lonely loser struggling with mental illness -who goes completely ignored through life when he’s not being bullied- and how this person finds less and less reasons to be polite and ‘put on a happy face’. Arthur is an underdog we all recognise, regardless of our race or gender, and the film raises the question that perhaps we need to look at ourselves closer in how we treat those in less fortunate situations than our own. It’s easy in this age of electronic distractions to adopt an ‘I’m alright Jack’ attitude, and perhaps it’s this ignorance to the cries for help of others that creates the Jokers of the real world.This is the most relevant and important film of our time.… Expand",10,2,"Oct  5, 2019"

From Iron Man launching a franchise bigger than any interconnected cinematic franchise in history to The Dark Knight being known as one of the bestFilms based on comic books have been the craze over the last decade or so, to say the least. From Iron Man launching a franchise bigger than any interconnected cinematic franchise in history to The Dark Knight being known as one of the best films of all time, we're currently living in the golden age of comic book adaptations, so it should come as no surprise that a few unexpected outings would be attempted as well. Joker has now hit theatres and while I can say right off the top that it won't be for all moviegoers, this is a fantastic piece of storytelling. Being alone his entire life and thrown to the side by society, Arthur Fleck still lives with his mother well into adulthood and has a full-time job as a street clown. Having a condition that causes him to uncontrollably laugh, this character study is engaging from start to finish. Slowly realizing the truth about his life, things begin to devolve into chaos in his mind. Joker is simply a study of the mind of someone who has nothing left to live for or be happy about. For this reason alone, this is going to be a tough watch for certain viewers. Having a homicidal maniac as your core focus is not exactly an easy sell.  Now, Joker shares quite a few similarities to other classic films, which is being criticized a lot throughout many reviews, but I didn't see that as a negative. There are so many formulas that have been emulated to create great works of fiction that calling this movie a rip-off would be an insult to the filmmakers. On top of that, this movie is held together by a performance by Joaquin Phoenix that's truly out of this world, so any minor issues I had were usually overshadowed by him.  Phoenix's portrayal of this character, like every actor who has played this character in the past, is extremely committed, whether or not you like the outcome. Thankfully, I think his portrayal is completely different from anyone who came before him, making this movie one that will be able to stand on its own for a long time. From his quirks when the film begins to where he ends up during the final act, each and every moment was riveting.  In the end, Joker does borrow a little too much from classic to really call it a masterpiece or perfect, but it's pretty close in my opinion, in terms of holding your interest for an unlikely anti-hero. It's directed very, very well by Todd Phillips and I was more than happy to see him evolve as a filmmaker here. This is something that I never thought I would see him do and, aside from the level of great comedy in a movie like The Hangover, this is probably his best work to date. I loved nearly everything about this movie, even though it will upset some viewers and make them feel very uncomfortable. In fact, for that reason alone, it has done its job very well. You're not supposed to root for him, but rather understand where his actions come from. This is a great film.… Expand",10,2,"Oct  5, 2019"

However, after all the comments and articles about how this movie is absolutely removed from everything from the comics, I expected just a good movie with a great performance from Joaquin Phoenix. Then, when I actually saw the movie I was really surprised. Because not only it was a great movie itself, but it was also a brilliant version of that world from the comic books and a Joker himself. It really reminded me of ''the Killing Joke'' that did something similar with the character of Joker. It made you feel empathy towards him, but at the same time you were not rooting for him, it made him more human. He was just a crazy person that had a rough life. He wasn't really a supervillain, which explains why Batman was even trying to help him in the end, but it was too late. Well, that's basically what happens in this movie. It just chooses a different path. It doesn't make him crazy through a chan of chemicals. It doesn't do it in one day. A few days. Or maybe even a life. You can see why Batman would do the same thing. Why he would try to help him. But just like in the comic, because of everything that happens in this movie, it would have been too late for that. So, as a fan of batman comic books, I was extremely happy. But again, it was also a great film in general. Cinematography, script, acting, directing, the score. Especially the score! It's the best score that I've heard this year. And of course, the performance of Joaquin Phoenix is just incredible. It's hard even to describe, you just have to see it. And no surprise that there is so much controversy around this film. Because it is controversial. It talks about difficult topics, but it doesn't hold one particular point of view on them.

MrMovieBuff,"For decades now, the comic book genre has always seen spectacle, fantasy, powers and it's mostly fantastical. However, in recent years, we have seen them evolve and try to put characters in the front, there have been many great deep characterFor decades now, the comic book genre has always seen spectacle, fantasy, powers and it's mostly fantastical. However, in recent years, we have seen them evolve and try to put characters in the front, there have been many great deep character moments in the genre with films from; 'The Dark Knight' (2008), 'Logan' (2017) and even 'Avengers: Endgame' (2019) focusing greatly on characters dealing with the situations they are in with those respective stories. Enter 'Joker', the latest standalone DC film from director Todd Phillips ('The Hangover') and he uses Joaquin Phoenix in the title role to tell this story of a man named Arthur Fleck. Arthur lives a very quiet, if not, insignificant life as a clown who holds up sale signs, he aspires to be a stand-up comedian and lives in a small apartment with his mother whose mental issues seem to pass onto him. Every night, Arthur and his mother like to watch ""Live with Murray Franklin"", and enjoy watching the talk show host Franklin (Robert DeNiro) bringing a sense of light and fun into their lives. The movie mainly focuses greatly on Arthur, and his turn from socially awkward individual, into a psychologically damaged sociopath. He has a condition which makes him laugh out loud uncontrollably in awkward situations, and he gets medication regularly to keep him sane. However, when a series of bad things happen to him day after day, and nothing seems to improve, Arthur then begins to question if it's him that's the problem, or is it the outside world. The film is appropriately bleak, and sets a very uncomfortable tone, with Phillips deliberately holding onto long shots for extended periods of time to create a sense of unease. Not to mention that you do feel bad for Arthur, the movie is very much told from his point of view, so you come to understand why Arthur behaves the way he does, not that it's justified, but it's in the nature of his character. As you know, the Joker has an infamously non-existent origin story. We just know him as a deranged clown who murders for the thrill. Here, Phillips has given the character, not only a name, but a plausible origin story that could work as a prequel to 'The Dark Knight' (2008), with some things altered here and there, of course. Phoenix is also terrific in the role, as his presence makes you feel unclean and uncomfortable, his voice and mannerisms convey a sympathetic sociopath, and there is even some subtlety to it as well. He doesn't try too hard to chew up the scenery, he just behaves appropriately to the environment that surrounds him. Not since the late Heath Ledger, have we seen this iconic Batman villain portrayed with such skill. Placing a comic book character and grounding him in a more realistic reality, just as James Mangold did to Wolverine with 'Logan' (2017), was definitely a smart move. It will remind you of two Scorsese classics such as; 'Taxi Driver' (1976) and 'The King of Comedy' (1982), both of which also star Robert DeNiro. I think it's great that the comic book genre was able to arrive at a point to tell a psychopathic story, we've never seen that in this genre before. Who knows when it will be the next time we see another comic film like this, but the fact that they can mix it up means this genre can bring surprises and is here to stay.… Expand",8,0,"Oct  5, 2019"

Joker is a movie that understands the mythos and the message of the character, no this movie does not make violence acceptable, this movie does not endorse white supremacy or white privilege and it tries to convey a message through the use of violence. The cinematography and lightning felt amazing and it immerses you in this 80s dirty and ugly Gotham City, the acting is phenomenal especially Phoenix, he does an incredible job and sometimes he doesn't even say it but you can understand what he is going through. My problem with the movie is that the script cant handle all of the themes subtly, especially when we are talking Arthur hallucinating, and they just couldn't lose the chance and they just had to put Bruce Wayne and the Wayne family in the movie. Also, there are somethings in the movie that goes nowhere, in the beginning, they talk about the garbage collectors having a strike and then they talk about because of the strike and the huge amount of garbage in the street they have now super rats? And then this goes nowhere and it is never mentioned again in the whole movie and it felt dumb. Talking about trying to be subtly, Arthurs's girlfriend being a hallucination I saw that coming a mile away, it's like the screenwriter had some good ideas but he just could not execute them very well. Overall Joker is a very good movie and it will get a cult following in the future (if it doesn't have already), the script has its problems like every other but it can still convey a very important message that I think it will be relevant for many years to come.… Expand",8,0,"Oct  5, 2019"

Forget thatFollowing in the paths of truly great movies like Taxi Driver and The Dark Knight, Joker (2019) is an in depth character study, with an electrifying performance by Joaquin Phoenix.Forget how superhero movies make you feel. Forget that you're even going to watch a superhero movie. Joker is one of the most realistic and effective take on a villain that has been put up on the big screen for ages. Technically solid, Joker again showcases why Joaquin Phoenix is one of the best actors working today and why The Joker is probably the most interesting comic book villain.The transition from a lonely loser to nothing less than a freedom fighter is depicted with style and vigour, the yellow and blue pallete, the nightscape of a very realistic Gotham providing a compelling backdrop to the crimes Joker commits -- which are in fact so relatable and understandable that viewers are forced to contemplate if what they're seeing on screen is actually moral or not. We all know the answer to that question however -- it is immoral. Crimes, especially murder is obviously, immoral. But the movie depicts a personality whose morality is dead. He's had enough. But the movie doesn't tell you that that's a good thing. It just depicts.A Roger Ebert quote fits quite well here - It's not what a movie is about, it's how it is about it.Joker doesn't shy away from gorey violence,and taking on controversial themes. And I liked that. Many didn't. Many thought the movie is spreading the ""wrong message"". To them I ask, tell me a villain who sends the ""right message"". I'll wait. Movies try so hard to portray a compelling character study of a protagonist who is a villain. They generally fail miserably in doing so. Joker smashes it out of the park.Follow me on insta @rosebudmoviereviews… Expand",9,0,"Oct  5, 2019"

This movie has me battling with myself. I went in expecting to see the Joker from Batman, instead i saw a man suffering a mental breakdown. If the movie I had paid to see was titled as so I would be standing up shouting from the rooftops about the movie that portrayed the descendence of a mind into a place of despair. The acting would be top level and the feel and pace of the movie would have been perfect. Phoenix's portrayal is fantastic and is at times purposely cringe worthy watching. That being said I had went to watch a portrayal of Batmans arch nemesis The Joker. This was not even close to the character, he wasnt smart, in fact he appeared to have a learning difficulty, he was in no way close to the Joker of the comic franchise.  As for the Batman timeline, the movie made no sense at all. It portrayed Bruce Wayne as 10 yrs old and Joker as approx 40yrs old.  Joker shud be retiring when Batman gets going. As for the Wayne family name this movie  doesnt treat it like the shining beacon in society, with suggestions of affairs and Thomas Wayne's public suggestion of Society being clowns.This movie was as far as it could be from being a Batman movieIf u want to watch a movie about a man having a mental breakdown. Its well acted and directed, its pace slow enough to watch the breakdown happen in great detail.As a movie its depicting that its 8 possibly 9/10BUT it was supposed to be about the Joker, and if you want to watch the Joker from Batman then this isnt the movie for you, you should go and re watch Heath Ledger give a masterclass in the Dark Knight.… Expand",4,8,"Oct  5, 2019"

All these hypocrites saying they walked out or were offended, yet will happily sit through John Wicke, the equaliser, IT, and enjoy the gratuitous violence.  This film shows why violence is a bad thing, and why it is such an evil thing to bully a vulnerable person and treat them with contempt for simply existing.   I believe why people are getting so offended is because the film brings home a number of issues currently affecting today’s society.  The truth hurts.  It offers realism and an insight into the minds of some of our peers who are suffering from mental health issues and have lost their way.  Phoenix's portrayal is truly masterful, he deserves acclaim for his performance.  The story is moving, dark and emotional.  The film is not that gory at all, I have seen much worse.  Don’t listen to the weak minded who are scared of this film.  It is absolutely worth a watch and will go down in history as one of the best films of all time.

UniversalReview,"2019's ""Joker"" is honestly a bit of an enigma, with controversy on one side, acclaim on the other, and a debate as to the film's true messages and quality raging all the while. So as someone who went in with next to no expectations, only a2019's ""Joker"" is honestly a bit of an enigma, with controversy on one side, acclaim on the other, and a debate as to the film's true messages and quality raging all the while. So as someone who went in with next to no expectations, only a rudimentary knowledge of the background discussion, and a healthy distrust of many of DC's more recent film offerings, what did I think?I think ""Joker"" is most-definitely a good film, but not a great one, all down to one fatal flaw. It unfortunately never stops leaping for that mystical ""higher bar"", the legendary status enjoyed by films like The Dark Knight, and in that eagerness overreaches and kills its true potential. At its most sincere, ""Joker"" succeeds in being a convincingly fiery crucible to forge such a legendary villain, but especially in the beginning, turns up the heat even more to the point of self-parody.When we're first dropped onto the dismal-yet-familiar streets of Gotham, the film wastes no time in setting the world against Phoenix's Arthur Fleck, and that over-eagerness was my core issue. There's no buildup, no hope, no sense of potential wasted: Without any world-building or context, Fleck existing just to get beaten down and beaten down is shockingly ineffective, proving the film's priorities are focused on the goal, rather than the beginning. Gangs of bullies and ruthless bosses feel more forced than villainous, transparent mechanisms that exist solely to get the character where he needs to be, rather than to provide the organic descent and societal backdrop we were promised. It feels shallow, and in essence, the film would've benefited from taking its foot of the accelerator for a moment and smelling the roses, because as it stands, ""Joker"" starts off doing 90 mph in a fifty, and hits you with all the subtlety and depth of a freight train.However, once the wheels are in motion and Fleck's descent begins, director Todd Phillips and Phoenix are more able to run wild, and this is where the film truly shines. After a shaky opening, the ensuing roller-coaster ride is truly a sight to behold. And why wouldn't it be? Hasn't the Joker always been more effective in the present, did Heath Ledger need a backstory to succeed? No! As we watch both Gotham and Fleck unravel, every revelation and every depraved act comes as a gut-punch, all building up to a live finale that perfectly fits the tone of the film while feeling authentically Joker, and an ending that wisely avoids the expected cliches and ends on a note of glee. Here, the Joker becomes a twisted hero in his own way. It wasn't the success Arthur Fleck had hoped for, but it feels like destiny nonetheless, and by the end all force and stiffness from the start of ""Joker's"" world fades away into a feeling of chilling plausibility.So to conclude, I would recommend ""Joker"" for anyone looking for a fresh take on the classic character. This isn't your typical superhero flick, and while the darkness and violence may be a turn-off for some, it's an experience most will enjoy. It's a film that starts off unconvincingly, but is sure to leave an impact by the end. And with such large clown-shoes to fill, ""Joker"" more or less reaches the bar.… Expand",7,5,"Oct  5, 2019"

Mannerisms were off the charts.This movie just really had no point to exist, it showed us nothing new or nothing we didn't expect already.

Let me start by saying that Joaquin Phoenix did an amazing job at portraying an unnerving malnourished mess. The movie even did a terrific job at transporting us to 1970s crumbling Gotham city gripped in turmoil.However, the movie failed to portray any resemblance of Joker and seemingly attempted to justify his extremist violent behavior.If any resemblance of the real joker were in this movie it would have been something fairly small that would have caused him to crack or perhaps he would have started killing just for the hell of it. The monster that is joker would've seeded protests, manipulated the police against the protesters, and ultimately incited chaos in some genius orchestration just to counterbalance justice...That's not Arthur. Arthur seems to be a character on the surface that might have been plucked from Clockwork Orange, Falling Down, or Taxi Driver... but he's actually something new. you see none of those potential inspirations repeatedly make a defense or justification for the characters decent. The movie repeatedly attempts (unsuccessfully) to garner sympathy for Arthur. first off it's not his fault as he is mentally I'll die to a brain injury he sustained as an abused child. he's next repeatedly bullied throughout the movie. the state then cuts off his medical supplies due to budget cuts. he becomes delusional off his meds and starts to fall deeper through the cracks whilst accidentally inspiring class warfare that parallels the occupy movement in its adoption of a symbolic mask and anger against wealth inequality. He finally becomes ""the joker"" giving a speech about how general society never thinks about what the bad guy might be going through (please don't try to make me feel for the criminally insane) and how society failed him and he was only brought on the show to be bullied. he then shoots the host and the protesters turn to violent rioters.in short the cold calculating jokers have all been replaced by a fumbling mentally ill sad victim. the movie seems to attempt justification for violent incels while villainizing the disgruntled lower class. for a hero movie it had some warped political narratives embedded.As I said though...

Terminator Dark Fate (for the brief seconds I saw while entering the IMAX Auditorium since there was a 5-Minute preview in front of Joker in IMAX) looks fookin’ spectacular. Such a shame Italy won’t release it in IMAX 3D…2. This movie has a great friendship with A Quiet Place for “Dead Silent...Stone Cold Audience I’ve ever had at a Movie”3.  DC Black may be the studio I’m most looking forward out of all the other CBM Studios,but it’s no surprise given Warner Bros’ fantastic year (so far)...End of notes.The worst part of Joker may be the fact that I’ve seen all of this coming from the trailers. Guy gets slapped by Society,he starts to get mad,and so here we have an Odyssey of Madness that’ll turn him into the Clown Prince Of Crime,yadda yadda,we all know it by now. But,the thing that makes it stand amongst other character studies done by the numbers is the rather unnerving nature of the character we’re following (played by Joaquin Phoenix with mesmerizing attitude) and the fact that,for a Director last known for making Comedies,this feels like such a huge directorial shift (besides the kinda harsh comment he made on Recent Comedies). This may be the scariest IMAX Experience I’ve had since...I dunno...Mission Impossible Fallout? Which isn’t saying much,considering I’ve never seen a scary movie in IMAX.What also fuels the movie up to 11 is the fact that this is my movie. A movie that says many things about the harsh and insulting society we’re living in right now (another movie like this is Taxi Driver,of which the movie takes inspiration from. No,seriously,there’s a sequence involving Arthur toying around with a gun that feels similar to Travis Bickle’s “you talking to me?”),which is better than great for me,as I despise the lots and lots of people that behave like they’re the most important being in existence,complete with self-indulgence and insults towards others. All spectacular stuff for this movie. But,while most of it feels earned,I don’t think it needs to fully embrace it,since there’s a minority about people who actually know what they’re doing and hope they can literally “rebuild the world” as it was. Yeah,I’m getting ahead of myself,but it’s something I really wanted to talk about in a long time,internet or not. And it feels unreal that I’m talking about it in a Comicbook Movie that shouldn’t work if done in other ways. But if it stopped itself from fully embracing the theme of Society,then we wouldn’t have gotten the big-ass epic finale it had,with a speech that,while feels forced by WB,didn’t bother me at all,especially with a worse gripe than the speech. That being the blatant and unnecessary Batman references. At first it was cute,but during the finale,it felt sort of rushed.  Not for Thomas Wayne,since he was part of the plot,but for the sake of the studio trying to Franchise this up,therefore losing the soul the movie was aiming to have,and making it just “Another Comicbook romp”. Speaking of that,yeah,it stars a Comicbook character as the main lead,and the title is Joker,but should I even consider it a Comicbook Movie? Character aside,this feels more a Character-driven film rather than a CBM,and,while there are action sequences (and Violence) in it,it doesn’t matter all that much considering the Nature of the Story we’re being told,nor is it as insulting as the troll reviewers are talking about (there are positive reviews,no worries,but I hate making fun of these critics,since it ain’t my thing,and I know there will always be more of them in other movies). But all in all,I think Joker is my Iron Man. While I’ve seen most Comicbook Movies by this point,I never had one where it felt like a proper introduction to the Genre (besides Spider-Verse),and anticipating it as “The Rebirth Of Comicbook Fare” was definitely my thing. Sure,it wasn’t the greatest movie of all everyone was talking about,but that still didn’t stop me from being thoroughly surprised by it. The fact it doesn’t show the DC logo at the beginning is already a Plus.… Expand",8,0,"Oct  6, 2019"

To try and compete with the high standard set by Ledger is an uphill struggle to say the least, but Phoenix's performance captivated me from start to finish. I love the continuity of the character. His portrayal of the character is dark and beautiful but still distinct from Ledger's. He has created his own mannerisms with the character. You can see the hard work he's put into this performance. From the look in his eyes, his stance around certain people. ""The Joker"" is undoubtebly a flawed person, but I've never sympathised with him before, or at least to the extent that I notice it. I find myself comparing our protagonist, Arthur, to Robert De Niro's character in Taxi Driver. You can see they're excluded from society, spat on, in a city that is rotten. One can sympathise with them at the start, but later on we see the cracks appear.The film has beautiful moments that tie it all together too. For instance, I appreciate how the beginning and end mirror eachother, and that the character ends up parallel to who he was at the start.It starts with a smile, and a psychiatrist,and ends with a smile, and a psychiatrist.Arthur at the start is trying to be happy in an oppressed and dysfunctional world.Arthur at the end is happy his life means something and he's bringing opportunity for people to make themselves happier through revolution, with the wall of the class divide burning away in Gotham.I also appreciate the use of theme in this film. From start to finish the film paints a sincere-feeling message about male mental health awareness and the problems that Social Exclusion can cause on vulnerable people- a theme which I feel should be at the forefront of society, but is so often shoved to the back in favour of other issues. The outrage from media outlets prior to release only purports this- practically encouraging a shooting in theatres so they can condemn the person who *they* gave the platform for atrocities to be committed through, via their constant publicity about it. Ironically, the film speaks directly to that, with the Late Night Show scene in the ending third of the film, martyrising Arthur as starting a revolution. The film isn't trying to advocate for murder of people, that's not the message one can take away from it. The real message I found was that vulnerable members of society should be treated. Arthur's character was neglected, beaten, ""tied to a radiator with bruises on him,"" and yet he remained in the house with his mother, and turned into a social outcast. He gets all the sources of help cut off from him, so he is left isolated. This speaks to contemporary American society too, where medical and mental help costs, and often is only available to those who might not need it as much as a working class family may, seen as most mental health issues lie with the impoverished. This film says a lot without coming off as insincere as other comic book character films do. It doesn't cram a message down your face with a one liner, nor does it try and deprocate itself through ""self-aware comedy"" like every other Marvel film (hint hint ""What Are Those!"" and every line said to make the characters awkward after a big moment)This feels like a true Tragedy. The art style of the film, the soundtrack with those harsh strings, vivid lighting in sections, and the overall design and portrayal of the character is in a world of its own. I thought nothing could top Ledger's performance, but honestly, Phoenix has me convinced.… Expand",9,0,"Oct  6, 2019"

It is unnerving, but that feeling is what a Joker movie should be in away. There are moments of the film that blur the line between reality and fantasy, that to me is another detail that screams who joker real is, with the only answer is multiple choice of who he is or was. If there was a Joker origin story that was true to the comics, it probably wouldn't be as impactful R rated or not. This movie will be discussed and analyzed in future youtube theory/philosophical vids much like the Nolan Trilogy has been studied.

The weak points are a certain female character that wasn't explored more, and a certain unnecessary sub plot which I am not going to spoil and let you judge for yourself. Overall very enjoyable movie and Joaquin's Joker is a worthy successor to the great Heath Ledger's Joker.

I was expecting Joaquin Phoenix's performance to be the only good thing about the movie but I got a lot more. Saying that Joaquin Phoenix was wonderful in his role would be stating the obvious, because pretty much everyone has praised his performance and I agree, he is honestly the best actor of the year so far. Both his acting and the writing of his character is what gives Arthur Fleck/Joker a realism that we have never seen before in any other interpretation of the character. The movie really made me get inside the mind of the title character, to see that he is not just ""a crazy person"" but that he was a human like anyone else. His journey to become the iconic villain is genuinely interesting, and made me care about the character. That is why I think that the character development and acting are the best things about the movie. Robert De Niro was also pretty good. I thought that he would ""phone it in"", but he ended up doing a nice job. The cinematography was also pretty good. There is a little amount of visual storytelling(not too much and it isn't like arthouse film level or anything) and the movie looks aesthetically beautiful to be honest.My issues with this movie are with the script. There were things that felt really cliché and unoriginal. Some of the social commentary is really on the nose and obvious, and when it is included in a conversation it feels more like lazy exposition and takes away from the realism intended. Soms of the plot twists were pretty obvious and the movie treats them as big reveals.So yeah, some script decisions were really a problem, at least for me, but other than that, this movie was reaaaally good. The gritty realism of Gotham City is done so right, making this a worthy ""spiritual successor"" to Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy.… Expand",8,0,"Oct  6, 2019"

Something so deeply unsettling, visceral, and yet impossible to turn away from. So mind-searingly horrific, yet deeply emotional and thematically resonant. So incredibly well-crafted and performed that I honestly cannot help but include it among my favorites for the entire year. I mean, look around. You can't swing a cat without striking someone with thoughts on this movie and its meanings/implications for our times. For all of this to emanate from a movie based on a comic book character honestly amazes me in the best way, no matter how exhausting some of the discussions have become. In an age where every comic book film is compared to and contrasted with every other iteration from its own canon, other canons, etc., I totally understand why there's a fatigue that's come about in response to it all. But here comes Todd Phillips (I'm honestly still having a hard time believing that he's the filmmaker behind this thing) with a mold-breaking, crowd-censuring treatise on everything that's wrong with our understanding of the downtrodden -- one that I feel still very elegantly straddles the line between doing this and absolutely holding the antiheroic antics of the protagonist to a standard of personal responsibility. It's a high-wire act of nerve-frying narrative choices, incredible cinematography, moral pyrotechnics, a performance that's honestly career-defining, and the Batman mythos. And it roundly accomplishes what it sets out to do. It warns. It scars. It contextualizes a world we all thought we understood in a way we could have never imagined.I love this. I love this and I know it's a movie that doesn't love me back.There's no doubt in my mind that, as a comic book movie, this has to be the greatest undertaking any creative team has ever had to assume, especially considering all the implications and discourses that the film's spawned. The creators knew the conversations that this movie was going to create and were undeterred and unafraid. I applaud them for it.… Expand",10,0,"Oct  6, 2019"

Joker came out this weekend with mixed reviews, viewers seemed to (mostly) really enjoy it, while critics reviewed it poorly. I watched it Sunday night, and the theater was mostly empty. I for the most part enjoyed the film myself; with a huge exception. The characterization of the Joker was far from what I expected. Allow me to explain, and please, stick with me until the end. This article will contain some plot point spoilers, so be forewarned! If you have not yet seen the film (and I think that you should), please click away now and watch it first!I’ll start with what I loved about Phoenix's Joker. His insanity was explained in a way that is believable, his delusions and his ‘condition’ help to shape and mold the character. That being said, I am a firm believer in never explaining the monster, when you do that it becomes less frightening. The way that the film explained it though (since it is an origin story).The big issue that I took with the characterization is this: The Joker (eventually) will have battles of wits with The Batman, who is, for all intents and purposes, the greatest detective alive. Keeping this in mind, it is imperative that The Joker be equally as intelligent as, if not more than, Bruce Wayne. That is not The Joker that we meet in this film! It is as if the writers placed all the points into luck and none into intelligence! They painted the character as a bumbling fool, he never outsmarted the police, he never tricked the mayor, he just stumbled into a way out of each situation until the end of the film.It feels like the writers did not understand the source material, or if they understood it, they simply did not care about it. There was no future proofing it. If they created in this Joker an idiot, there is no way that they can have that same Joker face Batman down the road. Like I said, I did enjoy the film mostly, I just took issue with the intelligence of (or lack of) the character.… Expand",7,0,"Oct  6, 2019"

It's not an action film, nor a superhero and it's only better in my opinion. Superb cinematography, the shots are powerful. The soundtrack is excellent and subtle, it is not intrusive.We follow the protagonist Arthur Fleck suffering from neurological problems and depression. He slowly slips into violence. The story is told by adopting his vision of things (This does not mean that those events occurred in this way... Look at the clues). The scenario relies on the spectator's ability to interpret the scenes, not everything is verbalized. In the theater, I heard someone say: ""I don't understand... ».In addition, the film asks the question what is our role in the appearance of this type of individual. He also takes a critical look at social classes.Joaquin Pheonix deserves an Oscar for his performance. Best movie I've seen since Blade Runner 2049. I'm going to get it on Blu-Ray, because it deserves to be revisited. 10/10. (It's also less violent than the Deadpool movies. The difference here is that violence is presented with seriousness.)Joker est un film de répertoire, sobre et très inspiré des œuvres de Martin Scorsese. Ce n’est pas un film d’action, ni de super héros et il en est que meilleur selon moi. Superbe cinématographie, les plans sont puissants. La trame sonore est excellente et subtile, elle n’est pas envahissante.Nous suivons le protagoniste Arthur Fleck souffrant de problèmes neurologiques et de dépression. Il glisse tranquillement vers la violence. L’histoire est racontée en adoptant sa vision des choses (Ça ne veut pas dire que les événements se sont produits de cette façon… Observez les indices). Le scénario compte sur la capacité du spectateur à interpréter les scènes, on ne verbalise pas tout. Dans la salle, j’ai entendu une personne dire : « Je ne comprends pas... ».De plus, le film pose la question quel est notre rôle dans l’apparition de ce type individu. Il porte également un regard critique sur les classes sociales.Joaquin Pheonix mérite un Oscar pour sa performance. Le meilleur film que j’ai vu depuis Blade Runner 2049.

This movie is something which everyone has to see it once in their lifetime.The 80's settings brings a darker filter to it, It also borrows heavily from movies of that era, including ""The King of Comedy"" and especially ""Taxi Driver"", in some scenes almost to the point of being a rip-off, which works wonders for it. It feels less like a Superhero/Villain Movie but more of a study.The movie does not praise violence and it's far from being about making the Joker a ""hero"" or him starting a movement. Violence is what happens in between and labeling the movie as such is a misinterpretation of the picture.Finally I think if you change the name of movie and the characters portrayed in it and the integrity of the movie and what they are trying to tell you remains the same then that movie deserves it's praise.

I'd like to think that this is one of the many origin stories that are inside his head. The movie itself was amazingly shot. Each scene is very colorful or chaotically dull, representing Arthur's mental state. At first, you really feel for him. But then he gets more and more deranged, and you can't tell what's reality and what's fantasy that's in his head anymore.I am kinda glad that there some humorous scenes here and there. Most horror movies in the past made monsters and killers goofier as the series went, ruining the experience. Not this movie though. The comedy in this movie feels really natural, which is weird because you just saw Arthur's craziness few scenes ago.For me, this movie was a low-key psychological horror.

SPOILER-FREE PART:  This movie did not waste a single shot, not a single line, not a single movement, from the very beginning shot to the very last shot... so much that I refused to leave my seat to use the restroom. It reminded me of late '70s Scorcese with a hint of Nolan and a dash of Aronofsky without being derivative.  Best character study on film, in my opinion.  Possibly the best origin story (though Deadpool is so much fun).  Joaquin does the impossible task of matching (if not surpassing) Ledger in creating a compelling, one-of-a-kind, surprising portrayal.  I couldn't find fault with anything. Manages to be inventive, yet it pays mad fan service.  *******BORDERLINE SPOILERS:  Unpredictable, with a twist (or is it?  wait it is?  no, no, I was wrong... maybe...).

Yes, there is people like this, there are people in trouble and do terrible things but instead of idealizing them, the movie to me at least, is a reality check that ponders on how we treat people and the consequences of not caring enough. The character is effectively a sick person suffering from mental illness in the looks for help that doesn't come his way, and is additionally mistreated by society- hence creating the Joker. Joaquin Phoenix did a tremendous job portraying the character, I wouldn't be surprised if he gets to be a candidate for best actor at the Oscars because he did a phenomenal performance. If I have an issue with the movie, it is the use of sound-the soundtrack overall is very good with violin pieces setting the depressing mood of the film, but in some instances the sound seemed intrusive- trying too hard to set an emotion or a moment instead of the actual film doing that by its own, creating a sense of superficiality to some of the scenes.

He hit the somber lows really well, and the lows were necessary fuel for the Joker's highs that he performed satisfactorily.

This feels like a treatise on anarchism written by a high schooler. Many people are calling it one note and it's true that it is one long minor chord. But it's also tonally inconsistent with itself. Violence is handled with ultra-realism. Everything else is distorted into a melancholy comic book-like sepia to the point that life has no grace notes and everything is dirty and cloudy. You could make the case that that's a representation of the Joker's mental state – he repeatedly says in the film that he's never experienced a good moment in his life. But does that even make sense?

For me Joker was great because it was different, it took its time to make you understand the character of Arthur Fleck and the plot was well written.First off to get it out of the way let me address the so called “controversy” of this film in my opinion. To me for the most part I never really saw any controversy, I knew going in that Joker was a villain and I expected the movie to show me the violent acts of the Joker character and yes some of the violence is brutal but was never glorified or overblown like in some R-rated movies(lookin at you Hellboy, no cap) but the purpose of the movie was to show you how someone can go from being a normal person and be broken by life and turn into a psychopath.Okay now let’s move on to the performances, I’m sure you’ve heard it somewhere and I’m gonna say it again Joaquin Phoenix was dope playing the role of Arthur Fleck/Joker. I usually don’t care for the oscars but I would like this man to win one. Joaquin made me feel sympathy for Arthur throughout the movie and potrayed Arthur’s mental health issues perfectly and when he turned into the Joker...I enjoyed his performance man. Robert Deniro as Murray Franklin (a talk show host) was good, Frances Conroy as Penny Fleck (Arthur’s mother) also gave a convincing performance as well. Brett Cullen as Thomas Wayne was also interesting as the movie gave a very different version of Thomas Wayne from other Batman related movies. The character of Thomas Wayne was almost cruel and colder than any other versions from the comic or movies and I appreciated that a lot.Zazie Beetz as Sophie was meh I mean she didn’t give a bad performance by any means it’s just that she was used for a certain plot point and twist that I saw coming from a mile away and I felt that her arc or character even was unneeded and her contribution to Arthur’s story would have been fine without her character.One thing I was worried about was that people in the movie were going to be unrealistically cruel to Arthur, however that wasn’t the case the movie handled that part pretty well and again I appreciated  that. The story of Arthur becoming Joker took its time and didn’t rush his transformation, the movie really made you understand Arthur’s life, his dreams, mental state, relationships with certain people and his interactions before everything turns upside down and starts doing Joker ish. Arthur’s downfall was heartbreaking to watch and you felt the consequences of being cruel to other people.However although I really liked that the movie took its time with the story and was really patient....I don’t really like the slow burn feel to this movie , its  it’s not that i require an action sequence every 15 minutes it’s just that some movies take unnecessary time and energy trying to deepen the story or character motivations and the pace of the movie can become very slow and drag on. Joker was never 100% boring to me but there were times that the movie almost became a drag to watch. The third act alone is a solid 10/10 you not only get to see the Joker character in full force but the themes that the movie was trying to convey come full circle, it became brutal, almost heartbreaking, tense and wild. Especially with its themes about people being unnecessarily cruel to one another. The key theme about how someone can turn evil after a series of bad things happening to someone, being an outcast in society basically how the world can be a cruel place and how some people will break under that pressure.Also what I really really liked that the movie never preaches about these themes but mostly uses the show don’t tell method almost the entire movie except very few instances whereby the movie tells you it’s themes through characters. Without saying too much my favorite scene of the movie was the interaction between Joker and  Murray.The movie had a dark tone to it and worked really well, the movie wasn’t  dark for the sake of being dark and there were some funny moments, not a lot since it was a very serious but had funny moments mostly dark humor I mean it’s a Joker movie so there are. A few nitpicks are that you don’t get to see the Joker character for long until the last act of the movie I get it’s an origin story but I wished there could have been a little more Joker scenes but it’s not a negative point but a wish really. Not many characters were really as interesting as Arthur Fleck or Murray and maybe Penny.Joker was great, one of the best DC and comic book movies of all time, had funny some scenes The Arthur Fleck character was amazing, the story was well written,when Arthur became Joker it was really awesome. The movie had really great themes but the movie is slow at times and had some uninteresting characters but what really matters, Joker put a smile on my face.… Expand",9,3,"Oct  7, 2019"

First and foremost some of these pretentious critics can suck on a limon. They have let their political views and ideologies blind them to the purely majestic yet gritty beauty that this film and Phoenix are. They themselves could never ever play a role even close to role Phoenix played, he dove deep in the mind of a psychopath with delusions of grandeur like no one has on film up to date. His performance was legendary, it still has me contemplating the roll days later; the cinematography felt so real and gritty i actually felt apart of that chaotic world threw the whole experience. Some critics say their was no message, well let me tell you something there is! 1. Don't mess with people or bully them be cause you don't know what their day or life has been like and what point of a breakdown they are in. 2. Mental health is a serious problem and those that have these issues are just people who just want to fit and most times they are just pushed aside into the gutters of this world to fend for themselves. It is when these people are overlooked and uncared for by their loved ones, friends, society and or the system that their illusions of grandeur become the chaotic tragedy of some people's reality.

Before anything else: this film deserves Oscar wins, not just nominations, for Lead Actor, Cinematography, and Original Score. It is visually beautiful and the music serves as a  perfect supporting actor to enhance the insanity into which Arthur Fleck degenerates. Society causes an already mentally ill loner to finish losing his mind and digress from wanting to spread joy and laughter throughout the world to wanting to kill those he feels have wronged him.Phoenix's performance is not necessarily better than Heath Ledger's, but it is more riveting, and that's saying something because I never really expected anyone to top any aspect of Ledger's take on Joker. I consider Ledger's Joker a bit more sadistic, but that's only because now we know one vision of where Joker came from. The most fun aspect of the character is that you can play him any way you want and it's still correct. He might tell you a knock knock joke or he might shoot your daughter through the spine just to see the look on your face. And anything in between.There really are no words to express how good this movie is. It is as perfect a film, in its genre, as The Godfather, or Schindler's List, or Casablanca, or Lawrence of Arabia. The professional critics, the ones who get paid by major newspapers to say how much they hate a movie, most of them despise this one because it appears to be a social commentary on what a mentally ill loner will do if society pushes him too far. Many critics call it dangerous and incendiary because it may incite some - well, mentally ill loner out there - to do what he sees Joker do in the movie.Guess what, critics? You're right. It is incendiary. Because it tells the truth. Unflinchingly. Without euphemisms. Anyone who hates this movie as a social commentary is probably part of the problem our society has right now. At least in America, mental disorders and diseases are spurned by those who don't have them as not real medical problems. This isn't true. The film sympathizes with Fleck for a good reason: if society had treated him better, he wouldn't have become the most evil monster in the history of comic book literature.That movie critics are writing such vituperative reviews of the film only proves the film's point: those critics hate it because it holds up a mirror to nature and forces them to confront their hatred of the truth of reality.Because of the controversy I can't predict its Oscar chances, but I believe they're good. Phoenix is genuinely unnerving in every single scene and the intensity gets tighter and tighter toward the end until it becomes absolutely unbearable during the scene on the Murray Franklin Show when Joker appears as a guest. De Niro may also deserve an Oscar nod. He supports the lead performance with perfect experience.How do I summarize such a masterpiece? If I had to use only one word, I think I'd say ""devastating."" But there's more to it than that. It's equal parts gritty crime drama, comic book movie, horror movie, and tear-jerker. At the end, when Joker is in Arkham Asylum running from the guards, everything is white and it reminds you of A Clockwork Orange. The whole film is inspired by Taxi Driver.Those who call it ""too dark, too violent and bloody"" must not have understood what they were getting into when buying a ticket to see any kind of film about the Joker character. He's dark and violent in the comic books. We live in an age of PG-13, which permits a larger audience and thus more money, but this film is no bloodier or violent than the average nasty action movie from the '80s and early '90s. The body count is about 10, most of them Joker's victims. The difference is that the violence hits hard! If you can stomach Saving Private Ryan or The Passion of the Christ, this film's violence is a walk in the park.You will leave the theater feeling devastated, overwhelmed by its magnificence, and yes, you'll feel inspired, but not to commit acts of violence. The critics don't seem to understand. This film does not glorify mental illness or the online ""incel"" community. It doesn't just try to speak to the latent anger of lonely, anti-social white guys who really need to vent their anger and frustration. It tells the entire world the following, very simple statement: the mentally ill need to be helped, loved, hugged, encouraged to seek treatment, be it medication or therapeutic conversations. They need to be shown in some way that there's no shame in being mentally ill. The only shame is in not seeking help.At the end, Joker tells Murray Franklin, on live TV, ""What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? I'll tell you what you get! You get what you **** deserve!"" Then he blows Franklin's brains out.It's unfortunate. It's painful and deplorable to look at. But Fleck is right. The writers and actors are right. In real life that is exactly what you get.… Expand",10,1,"Oct  7, 2019"

Although this movie draws influence from art-house cinema, there is very much still a Comic book feel to it.Everything from art direction to music, to the cinematography, and the performance by Phoenix, was perfection.I hope that DC continues down that road and experiments more with this tired genre.… Expand",10,1,"Oct  7, 2019"

hnestlyonthesly,"Joker is a troll of a film. It’s main business is provocation: making you feel bad for feeling happy, making you feel bad when you feel bad, shocking you with violence and gore and the indignities of being poor and sick and awkward. It hurtsJoker is a troll of a film. It’s main business is provocation: making you feel bad for feeling happy, making you feel bad when you feel bad, shocking you with violence and gore and the indignities of being poor and sick and awkward. It hurts to watch Phoenix move. It hurts to watch him walk or dance or laugh. The rictus of pain in which his body is permanently placed. He is at times dainty and fey, then red-hot and blundering, slapdash, improvisational, weak, timid, meek, then conniving and smooth, impossibly suave and impossibly kind, caring, confident, self-possessed, then unhinged. But his swings don’t come off as random or unpredictable: Arthur is unraveling, shedding the his psychic blocks.I’m writing this review earlier than the others, because I’m a few (ten) behind, and it seemed like this would be an urgent one for people on the fence. I’ve been following this film for a while now, mostly because of my fascination with Joaquin Phoenix but also because I’ve been waiting for the Suicide Squad/Venom movie I was promised. One that would revel in the amorality of comic book villainy, spend some time in the mud, build the stakes for a confrontation, and push back on the platitudes of 21st century superheroism. That’s not what this is. This is more.I can see why someone would walk out. At multiple points. Or call this empty and soulless, void of any soul or moral inspection. In some ways the film feels like a polemic, like something that could be watched totally unironically. But I sort of like that it’s missing its compass, errant, rambling, has that sort of colorless feel of a once-vibrant shirt that’s spent too much time in the wash. Mysteries abound, fake news is unconfirmable, the past is a Gatsbian destination, out of reach. At the same time, it’s tidy: dreams die, lines land, set pieces are constructed, and people end neatly. Phoenix performs performance, rehearsal, the molding of self, the telling of fiction, the face he pulls in that hospital scene is so perfectly gleeful.Every moment of sympathy is undercut by our knowledge, our assumption of the end. Every decision is undermined by the murkiness of his decision-making, the chaos of his moral system, and the slow spiral out of control. And what is most exciting is that it does really feel like a new way to tell stories in a genre that has been painting itself into boxes for the last ten, fifteen years. They’ve scraped everything cheerful and fun out of movie and left the husk of a story, the pockmarked battlefield of the present American psyche, what Friend calls, “a time capsule” movie, somewhat in the same intention as The Dead Don’t Die. It feels like a high water mark for dark, mirthless self-seriousness, in a way that seems inimitable, even as it invites comparisons to classics like Taxi Driver and contemporary analogs that were passed up for Oscar attention not too long ago, like First Reformed (2018).But even as I mention Ethan Hawke’s performance, there’s something distinctly daring about doing this as a comic book movie, where expectations are so high for such a different brand of humor. Phoenix’s portrayal finally makes Heath Ledger’s performance feel cartoonish where it used to seem dark and threatening. Ledger’s Joker was a talker, his terror was psychological, but Pheonix’s is bottled up, repressed, his terror is social, cultural.Joker is a movie for people who like movies but hate superhero movies. It’s worth your attention and it’s likely to irritate.… Expand",10,3,"Oct  7, 2019"

The ambiguity of this disturbingly uncomfortable film is its genius, and likely why the critics are so divided. This is a film devoid of morality, and social commentary despite being at its core a morality play. In all things the viewer is left to draw their own conclusions, interpret what was real or fantasy and ultimately fill in the blanks with their own beliefs.Joker touches on many issues and treats them with all the disdain that the main character exhibits: mental health services, gun control, workplace bullying, class divides, exploitative reality tv, anarchism, abuse of power, and sexual rejection are showcased, but each simultaneously argued from both sides in a quantum superposition of cinematography.This is a film with dichotomy as its only key theme.One of Joker’s most controversial scenes is the apartment invasion by Fleck on his neighbour and fantasy love interest Sophie, and the resolution is left entirely ambiguous. At the completion of the film like Schrodinger’s cat she remains simultaneously; alive and unharmed by her close encounter with a confused yet sympathetic mentally ill neighbour, and violated and possibly murdered in cold blood by an incel like maniac. How you choose to interpret this scene (and interpret you must) to complete the viewing will radically colour your opinion of Fleck’s actions and alter your final judgment of his actions.The possession and use of firearms is given a similar treatment by Joker, on one hand a dangerously unstable and disbarred man is given an unlicensed gun for ‘protection’ by a ‘concerned’ colleague, and it does end up saving Fleck’s life. On the face of it this illegal possession of a firearm is morally justified, however he uses it gratuitously, chasing and murdering a fleeing assailant and eventually as his descent continues even murdering innocents in a manner even the most debased are likely to find unpalatable.The ambiguities continue in the treatment of the rich and powerful as personified by Thomas Wayne an abusive, cheating millionaire using his power to exploit a vulnerable employee, deny his child aid, and run a cynical political campaign for personal gain. Or perhaps he is a fair man unjustly persecuted by a delusional former employee, with high morale standards and an agenda to fight corruption and bring social reform to Gotham. Joker goes out of its way to ensure that you can never truly know which permutation of these traits is real, and leaves the viewer as sole arbiter of their personal truthThe film piles these ambiguities decadently and aggressively, and at face value without subtlety, however I feel that the smartest aspect of the film is the careful balance and layering of these competing value judgements in a manner that seems to have confounded the critics. I have read many reviews decrying the lack of political and morale stance from the filmmakers, but I truly believe that this was a deliberate attempt by the creators to make a movie where the viewer is free to construct their own morale narrative.The main character Arthur Fleck brilliantly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix treats life with disdain, chain smoking his way through a miserable existence and deteriorating mental state with a slowly building anger and latterly a sense of empowerment through violence. Despite this he provides very little verbal exposition for his deeds allowing the viewer to project motive and ultimately judgement on his character.The multitude of narrative and morale ambiguities in the movie mean that by the conclusion each viewer has experienced their own personal Joker who largely reflects their own experience and worldview in a manner that few other stories have achieved. There exist infinitely as many Jokers as viewers, and fittingly this idea is visualised in the film with the proliferation of clowns as the film progresses.I believe that this is truly groundbreaking  storytelling combined with exemplary cinematography and that Joker will stand the test of time.… Expand",10,1,"Oct  8, 2019"

Anyways , this movie was an amalgamation of emotions stirred up for a person I didn’t think I ever cared for , aside from being a badass in a previous portrayal by Heath. Let’s put this to rest right now ; Joaquin’s Joker was so real to the point that I connected on a more personal level (than previous jokers including heaths) and I can see authenticity in this joker being THE joker that eventually faces off with Bats - even in this “depressing” formative period of his .... despite being exposed to an action packed super intelligent Heath Joker years before this . The feeling of powerlessness and a world against you is really what gets you down through your first 40 minutes or so in the movie but it’s not a depressingly down feeling it’s more of a contemplatively-down feeling for Arthur’s condition and his situation in life . Essentially , it’s hard to NOT feel for Arthur as opposed to what previous movies would conjure up in us for the joker - which always painted him as a one sided villain as opposed to the complex more than human Joker we see in this film.Overall the scenes were shot so well I felt like I was watching an old movie, which also helped complete the feeling of taxi driver (also that revolver Joker gets seems like a snubbed version of it), but also gave the setting of the film a perfect alibi - this WAS INDEED the time before Batman ; and we can tell from the scenery , the outfits and the props ... very well done.I feel although there’s no promise of a sequel , the director and cast HAS to deliver a sequel - as the roller coaster ride of this journey has just begun and they really pulled the tempo of the film off correctly as to really entice us to be hungry for more screen time of Arthur In his very earliest joker years .If I could , I would see this made into a tv series as it seems so realistic with the way it displayed this joker , and the action was spread out enough to create suspense and many other emotions . If this was done I would expect them to cast Joaquin , due to his great performance , or at least someone that can emulate his exact performance and demeanor - as this was a performance I didn’t expect to “attract” me so much as it did .Great film , 10/10 for me - if it weren’t for the critics mindlessly bashing this title I wouldn’t have written this review , but I feel like this is something we need to speak up about because everyone seeing this film either really likes it or LOVES it - BESIDES the critics ... hmmm I wonder why ? Maybe it has something to do with the AGENDA of those that wish to push a specific NARRATIVE for their platform? Look that’s fine and all but please be a bit more transparent with your bias if you choose to run a review website . Compare the critics to the user reviews , how many of each one and you will see who the liars are and who is telling the truth about the movie . Everythings an “opinion” they will say after slanging dirt in an untruthful review ... ok that’s fine but don’t go bashing something that was shot , edited , directed , and written WELL and try to pretend like it’s just some unbiased opinion, we can see through that ! I, like thousands of others , went into the film UNBIASED and loved it , do the same and you will too ; go in there thinking the movie will have your incel neighbor boy kill you , you will leave there confused just to go on your critic profile on meta critic and bash for no reason and that will guarantee you have a bad time under the guise of social semantics .… Expand",10,1,"Oct  8, 2019"

This movie is the depiction in the how privilege and mental health can affect someone through the worst of times now in the world mental health can affect people very horribly and how it would change someone for the words someone like Arthur this movie shows that. This movie has murders it shows them very graphically so you have a negative reaction to them because obviously murder is the negative thing but with that you also have to be mature about it and do understand that one of these things can happen that they could happen in real life because this movie is very grounded with no superhero shenanigans it is just about a person who is out of the worst of times it has themes of privilege and it shows this very strategically and openly when joker kills 3 Wall Street kids on a train it's not shown to be a good thing but also shows how they would have the privilege to be seen as the victim's when they were beating up joker on a on the train it also shows the side between poverty in the rich and people not communicating properly with the subplot of joker and Thomas Wayne being son and father this movie is an edgy it doesn't show the things that joker does is in a good way because he is a hurt character end he's it shows the turn of the good person that Arthur was through the bad person that you ever was because of his mental health and the things that he went through and it demonstrates this in this film it's not saying that they're okay but it is showing it because it's an origin story and if you're going to show a villains origin story it's not going to be very nice.… Expand",9,1,"Oct  8, 2019"

Although Joker leaves you wanting more at the end of the film, it also fails to keep you on the edge of your seat during the majority of it. Like a boxer who ends his rounds swinging hard during the last 30 seconds to gain favor in the judge's eyes. Joaquin does a great job interpreting the Joker when he finally gets to. However during most of the film rather than disturbed I only felt sorry for a man who, do to childhood trauma, let everyone walk all over him. The slightest  rejection from anyone would trigger his hysteria. Surprisingly, they didn't add a scene where he buys an ice cream cone and as he gets his first taste the scoop completely falls and he has a panic attack. Hanging by a thread, thanks to his medication. When fundings for  it  are cut off and after finding out the truth about his mother. The Joker is born 90 mins into the movie. I sat thru it. At the theater I attended, I witness about 6-10 people leaving during the fist hour. When it was over an individual clapped, four about 8 seconds, when no one follow he stopped. Wasn't the worst movie I ever saw  but definitely not a masterpiece.… Expand",6,4,"Oct  8, 2019"

The music by Hildur Guðnadóttir makes you almost touch the feeling of every scene, so we might feel sometimes sad, angry, happy even confused and surprised by the things that we can see during the movie. This elements got together for the Joker's apparition, and when we finally see him every scene feels so different. This new Joker aren't an anarchist or a gangster, this version was created to be the most human between the humans, Phillips got that way and he showed us that. The beautiful photography, the colors, every take, were made to complement the wonderful story and they helped so well on the purpose of the movie. That purpose/message that we can understand from the movie isn't just the violence or the fight against the richest searching for a more fair world; the message goes beyond that, exploring the hard life (of mentally ill) and making us reflect about how we (you, me, everybody) treat those that are different to us in a world that falls piece by piece (not so different to ours). The violence and the fights were a consequence of that, but the origin is in the real treat with people. That was Joker to me, a confused but pleasant (and amazing) travel around the hard life of Arthur Fleck.… Expand",10,1,"Oct  8, 2019"

If all you wanted in a Joker film was a crazy guy in face-paint doing bad things in the name of a half-baked philosophy that boils down to ""everyone is mean, and all mean people should die,"" then this is the movie for you. But if you wanted a Joker that's complex and menacing (a la Heath Ledger) this is a waste of time. Would this Joker walk into a room full of criminals and ""make a pencil disappear""? No. This Joker has no skills, no intelligence, nothing that makes him likable or even intimidating. In fact, if you take away his gun, this Joker is just a punching bag. What kind of arch-enemy for Batman is he supposed to be? There were so many opportunities to make Joker more than just the one-dimensional psychopath everyone sees him as. Why not make him a master chemist who was underestimated and disregarded because of his ""mental condition""? That could have explained the Laughing Gas, the acid, and the other deadly devices the Joker uses. Instead, we got this lazy homage to people who want to burn the world down because others don't fall over themselves to be their friend.

I saw Joker today.  I’m not sure what I was expecting but I was very disturbed while watching this movie. I disagree with many who assess the Joker as an anti-hero.  There’s absolutely nothing even remotely heroic about this character.  In fact, I think the movie is commenting on how absurd the notion is at the end of the movie. The Joker character does nothing out of a political motivation. It’s all reaction and anger. Sure, he enjoys the attention it gets him but to call him a hero out of the insanity spiral that he rides to the end is absurd.  The movement he sparks is entirely accidental and watching the crowd cheer him at the end is the pinnacle of deluded idiocy. They’ve turned a psychotic murderer into some kind of folk hero and I think the scene was intentionally meant to show this craziness for what it is. Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t hate this movie.  It was harrowing to watch this man come apart and descend into madness. It was well made but I think everyone is missing the point of Joker. He’s a villain and this movie show how he got there and how ridiculous it is to view him as anything else but a villain.… Expand",8,1,"Oct  9, 2019"

I’ve had the opportunity to watch it twice now, which if you haven’t, you should. Todd Phillips did an outstanding job directing this film, to my surprise. I watched a video where he said that he had the musical composer read the screenplay and make the music based off of that alone. Phillips then made the scenes with the influence from the music, letting the acting and the tone to go with it as well. Genius. Don’t even get me started on Joaquin Phoenix’s performance. Phenomenal. He is so enticing and believable when he plays Arthur Fleck, from his walking/ mannerisms to the way he laughs. One big thing of previous actors who have portrayed the Joker is to have their own flavor when it comes the “Joker’s laugh”. Joaquin took a more natural and painful laugh with Arthur having Pseudo-bulbar Affect and not being able to control his laughter, even in awkward situations. The fact you can see the pain in his eyes even when he’s uncontrollably laughing just shows how outstanding of an actor Joaquin is. Even though Arthur gets most of the screen time in a movie about him (lol), all the other side characters still feel extremely real. One thing that I’ve come to appreciate a lot about this film and about Todd Phillips, is that it’s not afraid to make you uncomfortable. It makes you question if it’s alright to have sympathy for a psychopath. It shows what can happen when the government and others choose to ignore the mentally ill, and just think nothing of those that it affects. Overall an outstanding movie, I suggest anyone that hasn’t seen it in theaters yet to go watch it! I know I’ll go a few more times!… Expand",10,1,"Oct  9, 2019"

Mostly since a lot of what they were doing was just trying to copy Marvel, ranging from an attempt at their own Guardians of the Galaxy with Suicide Squad or hiring Avengers scribe Joss Whedon to finish filming of the Justice League. But finally it seems DC has found its footing by focusing less on an extended universe and more on just making good standalone movies with tones playing to the strengths of their characters. We saw it earlier this year with the wholesomely hilarious Shazam and we’re definitely seeing it here with a film that completely upends all of our expectations for the comic book genre through Joker, a character drama which completely reinvents of DC’s most iconic villains.Taking place in a 70s version of Gotham (albeit a version of Gotham which looks strikingly similar to a 70s New York) the film follows Arthur Flecks descent into becoming the Joker. When we first meet him he’s already in a bad position. He’s stuck in a dead end job as a part time clown, caring for his frail mother in a rundown apartment, he’s taking seven different drugs to deal with his depression and keeps bursting into uncontrollable fits of laughter to the point where he’s in physical pain. Basically he’s just one bad day from complete lunacy and it seems that life is constantly beating him down to give him that one last push over the edge.Even the few lifelines that Arthur does have to his sanity seem to be brutally slashed over the course of the film, with many actions completely outside of Arthur’s control such as cuts to social care further isolating him from society. Bus riders treat him with disdain, kids beat him down in the street and we even get an interesting portrayal of Thomas Wayne as a snobby rich guy completely detached from the real problems faced by society. Though the way that almost every character in the city is completely unsympathetic is arguably done to a fault, as many characters in the film do end up being one dimensional characters with the sole goal of furthering Arthur’s descent. Though in showing us Arthur’s descent, Joaquin Phoenix delivers one of the greatest performances of the year so far. The Joker has so many great portrayals, ranging from the pure chaos of Heath Ledger to the comically homicidal showmanship of Mark Hamil, but Phoenix has still found his own way to leave a mark on the character by layering him with a sense of tragedy as we see the pain that goes towards creating a maniac. It’s one of those incredible performances where the transformation is so fluid, but so monumental that we go from sympathising with a man beaten down by a cruel system to terrified at a madman capable of tearing a city down. There are so many small touches that really stood out to me like Joaquin’s slow transformation from self hatred in to turning his anger on to those around him and that laugh which constantly sounds as if he’s about to burst in to tears. Though the part of his performance that struck me the most was the extreme weight loss Joaquin underwent to portray the Joker. Beyond giving us an interesting insight in to his self-harming nature at the start of the film, there’s a level of visual discomfort whenever he’s on screen in a similar way to Chritian Bale in The Machinist. Beyond seeing his unnaturally frail boney structure, Joaquin said that the extreme weight loss gave him a sense of fluidity throughout the film which really showed throughout the film as Phoenix always appeared to move with such an unnatural liveliness. Some of the films most striking moments are some dancing sequences scattered throughout the film where the Jokers homicidal nature starts to peak out with as his rhythm begins to match up with the films haunting score.  It’s somewhat ironic that the film received so many criticisms for its sympathetic portrayal of a psychopath given that the same criticisms were previously thrown at the films like Fight Club and Taxi Driver that influenced it. Regardless, it’s important to realise that at no point does this film ever glorify violence. And the film does get us to empathise with the pain that Arthur goes through during the film, however it never condones his actions. A lot of credit needs to go to Warner Bros for being willing to provide such free roam to create such a chilling vision of one of their most valuable characters. And even more credit needs to go to Todd Phillips himself, who spent a year campaigning to get his r-rated character study off the ground at a time when action spectacles dominate the screens. Whilst he does cover similar ground to the Scorsese films that inspired him, this isn’t just a carbon copy and he really brought a unique vision to the Joker. I just hope that following this films success, Warner Bros continues to experiment with the rest of DC’s pantheon.… Expand",8,2,"Oct 10, 2019"

Kacau gilanya! Kacau sintingnya! Kacau edannya! Jelas salah satu produk Warner Bros. terbaik tahun ini, bahkan dekade ini. “Joker” tegas, berani, provokatif, emosional, sekaligus mengerikan. Jika “Midsommar” sekadar mengganggu batin, “Joker” dengan nyata mengacaukan jiwa dan pikiran kalian ke tingkat di mana kalian menyadari turut delusional akibat sebuah film.Kewarasan kalian akan dipertanyakan kala menghadapi untuk harus bersikap simpatik terhadap karakter ini sebagai dampak dari kesehatan mentalnya atau mempertanyakan tindak kejahatannya yang semakin tidak terkendali. Tapi itulah Joker, bernama asli Arthur Fleck, salah seorang karakter antagonis legenda dan fenomenal dari sebuah karya fiksi. Film ini menghantarkan kita cerita lahirnya kriminal tersebut menjadi psikopat nomor 1 di Gotham. Di balik kisah asal muasalnya, “Joker” menyimpan lebih banyak isu dari yang dibayangkan. Sampah menumpuk di mana-mana, aksi berujung ricuh mengisi jalanan, hingga elit politik dan media tidak tahu diri yang terus meninggi di tengah kalang kabut segala konflik ini. Menonton “Joker” yang penuh ironi seakan menyaksikan dengan miris cerminan kondisi negara kita saat ini. “Perasaanku saja atau di luar sana semakin menggila?” tanya Joker.“Joker” memang berhasil menjadi sebuah tontonan kritik sosial yang provokatif. Namun, film ini punya isu lebih dari itu. “Joker” adalah sebuah drama-psikologis yang berdampak kuat pada kondisi mental personal seorang insan manusia, baik itu sang karakter maupun kita sebagai penonton.Joaquin Phoenix dalam penampilannya yang terus memukau di setiap film akhirnya tiba di puncaknya dalam film ini. Upayanya untuk menurunkan berat badan drastis tidak sia-sia. Sebagai Arthur, Phoenix dalam postur-postur mengerikan memutar anggota badannya seolah tulang-tulangnya terbuat dari plastik. Dan bagian terbaik adalah ketika ia berada di bawah tata rias badut dan tertawa maniak yang cukup untuk membuat bulu badan kalian tegak. Ini namanya penampilan ikonik! Kenapa Oscar masih begitu lama? Phoenix butuh penghargaan itu sekarang juga!Mau bagaimanapun, “Joker” tetap sebuah film yang diadaptasi dari karakter ‘villain’ Batman. Todd Phillips yang selain menjabat sebagai sutradara tapi juga salah satu penulis naskahnya melakukan segenap usaha untuk memasukkan Bruce Wayne alias Batman ke dalam film ini. Pada akhirnya, “Joker” memang sebuah prekuel kisah hidup Batman. Namun, kita semua tetap tahu bahwa “Joker” bukanlah film buku komik biasa. Ini adalah film dari komik yang menyakitkan dan realistis.Phillips mengaitkan Arthur dengan Wayne dalam sejumlah narasi dan momen yang mengejutkan. Ditambah beberapa adegan brutal bersimbah darah dan iringan musik pengiring mencekam dari Hildur Guðnadóttir, semua itu membuat kita sedikit teralihkan — atau malah kian stres — dari alur “Joker” yang sudah lebih dari cukup membuat kepala berat.Phillips yang dulunya menangani trilogi komedi-dewasa “The Hangover” sempat disangsikan untuk menggarap proyek ambisius ini. Namun setelah menyaksikan film ini, aku senang Phillips bisa mengaplikasikan keahliannya dengan baik dalam ‘humor’. Kita tahu bukan bahwa kehidupan itu perbedaan tipis antara komedi dan tragedi?Arthur di awal adalah sosok yang periang. Masih ada pula beberapa orang yang setidaknya melingkupinya dengan energi positif. Seperti ibunya yang renta sakit-sakitan tapi sangat menyayangi Arthur. Atau tetangganya, Sophie Dumond (diperankan oleh Zazie Beetz yang sayang tidak mendapat jatah pendalaman karakter lebih) yang sedikit menaruh perhatian. Dan ketika semua hal telah mencapai batasnya dan pilihan moral Arthur berubah, tidak ada yang bisa menghentikannya sebagai Yang Mulia Pangeran Badut Kejahatan dalam 15 menit terakhir film yang luar biasa!… Expand",10,2,"Oct 10, 2019"

Then, the reviews started to drop. Still wasn't sure if I would likeDC can STILL give us a compelling movie. Wasn't quite hyped about it, I mean, an origin story of a villain made by the director of Hangover movies; what could I even expect? Then, the reviews started to drop. Still wasn't sure if I would like it. And after I saw it, it was way better than I thought it would be. I won't call it a masterpiece, but it definitely is on my top 3 DC films of all times! ..Good : There's hardly anything bad about Joker. Joaquin Phoenix does a great job of bringing the character into life. Rather than a typical superhero/supervillain origin story, we get to see a psychological drama + horror, and thank God, we got that. I love the genre, I love films like Infinity War, Days of Future Past, Endgame and Raimi's Spider-Man. But occasionally, it's really good to take a break from such films. It's, kind of, in the category of films like Unbreakable. Basically, the movie is (no spoilers ahead) Arthur, being tormented by the society and being a mentally unstable loner, loses his mind after the constant torment and after that, all hell breaks loose. That's all the movie shows. It would be quite difficult to give a really good story for a plot like this, since there are many movies with this kind of plot (awfully crappy ones included). I completely liked this movie, means the screenplay and direction worked for me. You can feel for Arthur, whenever the movie asks you to. You want to root for Arthur, but you know that it will mean some incredibly terrible things will happen. We see him slowly transition into Joker, and when he completely turns into the Joker it is worth a round of applause. We feel good as well as terrified with the actions of the Joker whenever he snaps and crazy stuff happens. Without getting into spoilers, I would say - in short - that it has many quotable lines and each of them make sense. Whatever Joker (a psychopath) says is more realistic than what a sane person says. And obviously has some sick, terrifying and gruesome Joker moments that a proper Joker movie should have. If it's not clear by the trailers, there's no Batman here. But (again, no spoilers) it does have some Batman references to support the movie. It could've created a mess and might have felt like a shoehorned plotline, but it plays out as a proper support for the main story and the transition of Arthur into Joker. ..Mixed : It is a good thing that the movie has a 70s psycho horror vibe to it. But, it could've been more original. Like many others have pointed out, it's similar to Taxi Driver by Scorsese. While it wasn't a copy and paste of Taxi Driver, but some parts make it obvious that the movie was inspired by Taxi Driver. Not necessarily a bad thing, the movie has the elements as a homage-ish way, but looking at how well made it was, it could've been slightly more original. And, it may feel a bit slow for some people, though it's worth your time. ..My take on the controversy : It can happen that some morons might watch this film and cause violence. It can happen with any violent movie. But, even though it justified the Joker's actions, it doesn't show them to be right. Speaking of violence, it's just psychologically compelling horror. It's less violent than Deadpool, but feels more violent as it's a serious movie. So, glorification and siding with a psychopath is a complete and total f**king bulls**t. ..Conclusion : It's a must watch. You don't need to follow any of the DC movies to understand it. But do not expect it to be a typical superhero action film with CGI battles and a spectacle. Wrong expectations might ruin the experience. Else, I found it to be better than The Dark Knight Rises. And TDKR is one of my favorites in the genre. If a Nolan movie is replaced by another movie in my list, you may consider it to be great. One last thing, people causing violence because of Joker would be equivalent to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly inspiring three people to have a gun duel for some gold. ..Rating:Score : 10/10Grade : A+… Expand",10,2,"Oct 10, 2019"

""All I have are negative thoughts""A masterpiece. It's brilliant. Exceptional. Bla, bla, bla.If I were to cover the full scope of this movie's brilliance you'd be here all night. First of all my problems with some people's criticism of the film:Over the top violence???!!! Yeah, nah. What absolute BS, clearly Deadpool and Game of Thrones exist in a difference universe. So you think it will cause mass violence or people who are messed up to get what? More messed up? Yeah well you should have thought of that crap 50 years ago. And let's just forget about movies like the Shining or Silence of the Lambs. Yeah, The Joker is going to be absolutely detrimental to society, cause shootings, oh no, ban the film - eat my arse. The media is just encouraging people to do something stupid by bringing that sort of drivel to everyone's attention. Not the Joker, the media is far more detrimental to society than anything else. Unfortunately it's impossible to have an entirely objective media entity without bias. Well that rant went on for a while, what was I talking about?Ahh yeah, what's great about the film:Holy crap Joaquin Pheonix is a bloody legend, his performance as Arthur Fleck in his transition from slightly mentally f***ed dude to majorly mentally f***ed dude (i.e. The Joker) is impeccable. His portrayal of The Joker is definitely on even terms with Heath's, and Heath created the best villain any superhero movie has ever done. Rest In Peace Heath Ledger. The way in which the film connected Arthur to the Wayne family and specifically Bruce by creating a mystery around Arthur's parentage was extemely well done. If only Todd and his crew were willing to connect this Joker to The Batman in later films, because they set the scene for that possibility quite perfectly, unfortunately that notion is all f**kery. Robert Pattinson, surely you can't do anything worse than Affleck or Clooney, but I've seen Twilight. However, I also agree that you could make a really good Bruce Wayne and Batman. See you in 2021.Ok, Arthur's laugh was mind-blowing, and the Joker laugh is hard to do well (I've tried); especially if you're going for it at a new angle, Pheonix's laugh both gave me the creeps and made me crack up at certain points during the film. Honestly, that scene where he's watching the stand-up comedy, but he laughs out of time with the audience, and at the most unfunny lines that are only part of the build up to the actual punchline. Bloody hilarious. Yeah, my favourite scene in the movie I reckon. You might say that it was an insignificant scene, but it does a really fine job of depicting Arthur's detachment to other people and society in general.The dark humour is crafted expertly. At least I think so; at my cinema I felt like me and my mate were the only ones laughing throughout the film. Everyone else must just have been wonder-struck at how good the film was.  Arthur's dancing is simply sublime, and I'm not kidding; him busting a move in a public bathroom after he just busted the s**t out of three wankers on a train again did an excellent job of exploring his minor psychological issues. What more can I say, oh yeah, hehehe. Dwarf. I was sort of shocked when he killed that dude, Randall, I'm not absolutely sure why in cosideration. But when the Gary couldn't reach the latch, I laughed a bit guiltily. Arthur Fleck: I don’t want you to worry about money, mom. I mean, everybody’s telling me that my standup’s ready for the big clubs.Penny Fleck: But what makes you think you could do that?Arthur Fleck: What do you mean?Penny Fleck: I mean, don’t you have to be funny to be a comedian?Hahaha, So good, so good....I wanna talk about his facial expressions, the riots the were invoked by his supposed ""vigilante"" actions, and his therapy sessions. But I don't have enough time, so here the last thoughts.That moment when he eccentuated the smile and red paint on his face with his blood whilst amongst his supporters was golden. His face, sorry, fate is sealed and he is now The joker.His speech and killing Murray on the talk show. Quite satisfying, Murray's talk show was great symbolism of a problem in society. Murray wants to find dirt on you, other people will find it funny, takes it much too far, Murray doesn't give a s**t Arthur kills him. The twist of him only imagining his relationshop with Sophie.The Ending Scene - grim, yet amusing.I didn't look to closely in to theme, plot devices, and whatnot, but there are plenty of other opinion pieces that talk about that stuff.I'm really looking forward to what becomes of Arthur Fleck. 10/10Oh, no.

A dark movie in every way. Folks that are bombing on it see this and it frankly depresses them and robs them of hope. After seeing it, I left the theater knowing what the Joker may have been feeling, likewise depressed and hopeless. The gaps left in the Jokers life story before we come to where he has arrived in the movie are easy enough to fill in just because it's the same sad story we have played witness to on the web and in the news for decades now.  It's a cruel, cruel world indeed. A movie with a message many folks have obviously already tuned into.  It asks if maybe we should all  buckle up, this could become a bumpy ride.

La actuación de Joaquin Phoenix da para un oscar, realmente se lo merece. Incluso la risa tuvo que aprender. Esa ""performance"" que realizó en este film ya es increíble, no se necesita más nada de él, pues ya se comprobó que es un gran actor y está hecho para ganarse un oscar. Esta actuación que nos brindó hizo que la película sea mucho más interesante y triste, contemplábamos cómo su enfermedad mental crecía a pasos agigantados. El clímax está muy bien logrado y ejecutado, es lo mejor que tiene el film. En cuanto a ambientación, se mostraba lo peor de las calles de NY, los lugares más lúgubres y oscuros. Hay algunas escenas en particular que son completamente inquietantes, pero que a su vez, son espectaculares. Joker, sin dudas, es un film muy sólido y estructurado, a base de la notable actuación de Joaquin Phoenix y su violencia explícita y dura, además de sus complementos adicionales como la banda sonora, escenografías, los planos y ambientación generan que la película sea aún más perfecta.

As opposed to typical fluff and cartoonish action scenes, however, this film doesn't horse around with pale expectations from the supervillain-following crowd.  ""Joker"" takes itself entirely seriously and unapologetic in it's many-faceted presentation of the main character, played by former renegade actor Joachin Phoenix, with the apparent attempt to dissect this guy's psyche' within the framework of a totally serious explanation of humour vs. tragedy and evil vs. good.  To the surprise of few, these analytics go only so far, leaving the audience to stitch the elements together for themselves.The effort was noble, successful in a limited sort of way given how hampered this film is by some rather intrusive flaws.  First and foremost to my eye -- or more precisely, to my ear -- is miscasting Phoenix as a clown who doesn't quite get the clown-laugh down convincingly; then again, perhaps this was an intentional faux pas (either by Direction or good Acting) in conveying Arthur Fleck's (Joker's) strain and frustration in playing the part of a professional funny man, when his personal life is in ruins.  Personally, I found the rendition more ear-hurting and off-color than convincing, but who can say ?The other quite noticeable bug-a-boo in this deeply disturbing tale is how, once in a while, random elements of older films are deliberately inserted into the action, not so much to enhance the story line but to throw in talking points among viewers.  The most recognizable was the choice of Robert Di Niro as TV variety show host Murray Franklin in, for those who can recall, a blatant re-seating of the same star as wannabe show host Rupert Pupkin in 1982's black comedy ""The King of Comedy"", easily a better and more engaging flick.  Tho it may be a facsimile of ""Joker""'s intent to date it relative to its setting and scenes' demands, Franklin's jokes and one-liners were awfully lite and minimally funny -- once again a probable counter-play to Fleck's ironic humorous twists, given that he is by this point in the picture revealed as a murderer.Another example of surreal connection to an earlier cinematic work was when rioting clowns protesting the mayoral campaign of Tom Wayne -- that's right, the father of future crime-fighter Batman -- began chanting something along the lines of ""We're mad as hell and won't take it anymore !!"" a la 1975's landmark movie ""Network"" starring Peter Finch and Faye Dunaway.  Perhaps this critic is too dense to pick up on some deep significance of this ""borrowed"" mass quotation, yet all I know is its use was so distracting that it only served as a mild giggle, tending to take away from the built-up drama of the story.It is understandable the upset many have over the release of this subject matter in a time of firearm mayhem, but what really bothers me is the timing vis-a-vis Halloween.  Here's hoping sanity and security prevail, so as not to end up with a Thursday-Bloody-Thursday . . .… Expand",7,4,"Oct 11, 2019"

It is dark, it is brutal and it is a good movie.Arthur Fleck was dealt the worst hand imaginable when he was born. He was adopted by a delusional, mentally ill woman that had an abusive boyfriend. Other than that, she stood by as this man beat and abused her adopted son... You feel that? That depression? Well now imagine if that kid grows up, becomes a clown while having mental problems, and the city is going through a recess of sorts that cuts the funding of his social worker that prescribes his anti-depressive medication! We meet Arthur when he's already at the edge of falling down, but when he stops receiving his medication and accepts his own emotions towards society's standards, he finally finds himself. And with him Gotham city takes justice in its own hands, becoming sodom and gomorra. What is great, is how we see a very different perspective of Thomas Wayne and the elite class then we are used to from the Batman movies.

It's a really gritty character study of quite possibly the most popular villian in all of comicsafter a couple of days of processing this film as one really needs to do afterwards, here are my thoughts on itI very much enjoyed this film. It's a really gritty character study of quite possibly the most popular villian in all of comics which sets itself apart from all other films in the superhero/supervillian genre.As the viewer we are invited to empathise with our protagonist Arthur Flack, an already very damaged man when we meet him, yet the degree of how damaged is only revealed later in the film. For the message of this film is monsters are rarely born, but created by other monsters. A statement which is very true in the world we live in. And yet still while making this point the film still successfully falls short of trying to justify any of his horrible actions he makes later as the joker. While at first it seems like a very straight forward narrative. As the film progresses it becomes increasingly clear that there is a lot more going on as it draws inspiration from some very prominent graphic novels such as The Killing Joke and The Dark Knight Returns, and I do feel a second viewing may be required. Being set around the late 70s/early 80s, the film is made to look, though a combination of camera angles and colour palettes very much like films made in that era with a soundtrack to suit. It even intentionally parodies key films from that era, the 2 obvious ones being Taxi Driver and King of Comedy with Robert De Niro being cast as a very clear homage. Reasons for such parodies become clear upon the completion of the film.The standout feature of this film is Joaquin Phoenix's performance, which is comparable to but still distinguished from Heath Ledgers Joker. I still don't know which one I prefer or if I prefer one over the other, as both work perfectly within their own films and I think can both sit at the top next to each other for their own reasons. Early on in the film there is a very specific and brilliant character trait revealed about Joaquin's character Arthur Fleck which completely alters the context of all his self expressions throughout the film.Personally I think this film is best viewed as a very black comedy. And while it is probably not the best film made this year, it is still a very good film and is exactly what you want in a Joker movie, so from me gets 8/10P.S. anyone going into this film expecting an incel hero worship narrative as promised in various articles online, you will not find that here, unless you go in completely ignorant of what is presented in front of you… Expand",8,1,"Oct 11, 2019"

The ""imminent violence"" narrative that's been pushed by media outlets is nothing more than wishful thinking. This movie is like the opposite of Captain Marvel in terms of critics/media pushing their agenda. Honestly, it's baffling. They didn't have a problem with Nightcrawler, which is an extremely similar film, they lauded The Dark Knight.

The slow methodical pacing matching Arthur's hit after hit to his sense of self and the combined growing anger if the city around him, perfectly in step with the tense and impeccable score. It appropriately comments of today's resentment towards the super  Rich and thier abuse of the common people and those who need the most help in order to make themselves more money. You can understand Arthur's transformation in the extreme situation he is in. The tension carries on into the final act where you can tell from the get go that it will all come to a boil, but you don't know exactly how. Complaints about violence in this movie are unfounded and foolish. It is frankly mild compared to other movies but touches on volatile issues that effect many people around the world. And if it doesn't scare you in that aspect, then it wouldn't have done it's job.My only criticisms of the movie would be the amount in which it overtly pulls from other movies, sometimes past the point of homages to feeling a tad weak on it's own feet. But if nothing else it managed to bring the same elements of those movies into a more socially relevant story about an iconic character.It's just a true shame we won't see this Joker outside of his microcosm.Go see this movie.… Expand",9,1,"Oct 11, 2019"

JOKER is an absolute cinematic masterpiece. It pains me that so many ""critics"" rip into this movie for absolutely absurd reasons. This film is probably the best ""superhero"" movie produced since 2008. Of course, it isn't a superhero film, but it is made by DC with a comic character as the protagonist. I have seen this movie TWICE and I am more impressed with this solo project than I am with the entirety of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC Extended Universe AND 20th Century Fox X-Men Universe combined. Movies like The Dark Knight and Logan have proved superhero movies can be as much a brilliant art-piece as the most beautiful films ever made (Films like The Green Mile, Fight Club, Pulp Fiction, etc..), and so does JOKER.Joaquin Phoenix is goddamn phenomenal in the role, he absolutely carries this character the whole way through and I could not see a single other person playing this character so well. Joaquin terrifies me in this movie; it's honestly insane how crazy and scary he is, while also evoking a ton of sympathy from me in the opening act.If I could describe his portrayal in the best way I could, I would say: at the start of this film, he makes me want to curl up and cry. At the end of this film, he makes me want to cry for an entirely different reason. And that's not even all down to Joaquin.Todd Phillips has crafted the PERFECT comic book movie in my eyes. The camera work, the directing, the writing, the story, the plot twists... It is all amazing. This film truly messes with you in the most incredible way a movie could with some very Fight Club style plot twists that left me stunned. I remember being sat in the cinema for my first viewing gawking at the whole thing with my hands behind my head and my eyes widened watching in disbelief and horror and pure amusement and entertainment. And on my second viewing, I remember being so entertained by the amount of things you pick up after the first watch: all the dots that connect together, all the foreshadowing and clues and hints... It's truly magnificent how a movie can make me walk out giving it a 10/10 TWICE. I'd be willing to say on second viewing it is a lot more entertaining than the first viewing in multiple ways, which is surprising seeing as I left the first time utterly mesmerized. To say the body count in this film is rather low, the violence and brutality is extremely high. It's not like any other basic blockbuster that presents killing as an easy one-shot and dead scenario... No. This film presents killing as insanely harsh and difficult. Even the character Arthur Fleck shooting someone with a handgun once comes across as terrifying, in one of the final scenes. And that scissors kill was absolutely paralyzing. I sat there in my seat in utter dread and... well, horror. I don't know how else to describe it. HORROR.The critics are saying this film glamorizes violence and many other ridiculous things. But, at its core, no it does not glamorize violence. It discourages it, if anything. It discourages a lot of things. This is a very accurate representation of the every man who is constantly picked on and wronged by society. It presents the world outside of the ivory tower every movie protagonist seems to live in. I know a lot of people like those that pick on Arthur Fleck in this film. And the film should be a lesson for people to not act like this at all, otherwise extreme events may ensue. And it glamorizing violence is a ridiculous statement, as it presents killing as horrifying, dark and difficult. It shook me to the core seeing deaths in this movie, and definitely gave me the opposite opinion on ""cool, brutal"" kills in movies, like in the John Wick movies. Now, I cannot talk about this film without briefly mentioning Gotham City. The best representation of Gotham City in any DC movie.The Dark Knight Trilogy presented it as gritty and chaotic, but again that was through the eyes of Batman. And it was always full of explosions and action and riots. The Tim Burton movies presented it as an over-the-top, steampunk and bleak area. The DCEU presents it as... Nothing. And the Arkham games present it as gritty and crime infested. JOKER presents it as an awful place to live, full of stuck-up, rich pricks who pick on the less fortunate. Much like any city, but it gets its own character. It's compact, it's corrupted, and it's dirty. It's like a mirror image of Arthur Fleck's mental state. It's run down and it's getting worse and worse without the help of Thomas Wayne, who acts like he cares about the events occurring within the city and the protagonist, but really he's selfish and only cares for himself and his family. It's incredibly poetic.And the scene with the Waynes... I needn't say much but... It's possibly the best representation of the murders made, and the poetry of Joker's birth happening with Batman's birth is incredible.The ending, too, left me speechless and in awe.This film is very well deserving of a 10/10… Expand",10,0,"Oct 12, 2019"

This film messes with your emotions. There are scenes where you are not sure if you should laugh or feel sad (kind of how Fry from Futurama was conflicted with fear and joy when sentenced to death by snu-snu). There are moments that make you laugh (if you like dark humor like me). The comedy is similar to Joan Cornella’s morbid comedic illustrations. Joaquin Phoenix’s acting makes the character believable. His unique laughter sounds a bit painful and sad. When the situation goes south, the actor does a great job of performing the fight or flight behavior. Joaquin has an interesting and kind of silly way of running that fits the clown character appropriately (because he is a clown, it makes sense to me). The character is not a simple, black and white personality, instead he is a complex multi-layered individual that makes him entertaining to observe.The movie is realistic/grounded. Corrupt behavior is created and not born and there is tons of research to back this up. The Joker was not born with a corrupt mind. The film does a great job showing how the environment molded his corrupt behavior. Thomas Wayne’s portrayal is believable because someone in his position of wealth and power would behave the way he does (although there are a few wealthy people out there that are cool). The film has high quality violence (laugh out loud). This movie makes the violence feel shocking and serious. Other movies have too much violence that it starts to feel cheap and not a big deal (these films are still fun to watch though).This is one of the reasons why I love video games like The Last of Us or movies like Coco because they put plenty of effort in all of the departments (story, character development, believable acting, and an effective atmosphere). It is a memorable experience, it has substance, and it made me feel like this **** matters. Movie of the year for me.… Expand",10,0,"Oct 12, 2019"

Joker, a highly anticipated film of 2019 directed from the man who brought you The HangoverWanna hear a joke?  What do you get when the media attempts to slander a film against their own nonsensical agenda?  You get a damn near masterpiece!  Joker, a highly anticipated film of 2019 directed from the man who brought you The Hangover trilogy, Todd Phillips and starring multi award winning/nominee Joaquin Phoenix as the infamous jester of crime play into one of this year's best cinema.  Truly, this movie is a must see for mature audiences and must I say, there is no danger to concern one's self with as there has been far more violently created pictures before.  The story is carried vigorously throughout by Mr. Phoenix as a mentally ill man who descends further into his own madness; is well thought and wonderfully played.  A multitude of emotion this movie may convey to it's viewer as it will range from dark and sad to some humor with moments of joy when the character reaches his downfall.  Much like proven personality disorders that an individual can wildly change their current state of emotion within a short period of time, this movie understands the topic of discussion and is something I appreciate.  Robert De Niro, though a short screen time; gives a fair performance and for the remaining supporting cast does equally well.  And composer, Hildur Guðnadóttir who also elevated her work into the hit miniseries Chernobyl, brings a harmonious though haunting score that gives the character Arthur Fleck/Joker balletic virtuosity.  The only fault I can suggest of the movie is that I feel the protagonist's bullying can be seen as a bit cliché.  Again, if you appreciate good filming to an artistically sense of purpose similarly to that of a Martin Scorsese piece, this is a definite must see!… Expand",9,1,"Oct 12, 2019"

MarkHReviews,"“Joker” is a lot like the musical “Wicked.”  Both offer backstories for iconic characters.  “Wicked” retells “The Wizard of Oz”; “Joker” explains the genesis of Batman’s arch-nemesis.  “Joker,” however, is “Wicked” without the upbeat music,“Joker” is a lot like the musical “Wicked.”  Both offer backstories for iconic characters.  “Wicked” retells “The Wizard of Oz”; “Joker” explains the genesis of Batman’s arch-nemesis.  “Joker,” however, is “Wicked” without the upbeat music, the dancing, the redemptive friendships of key characters or songs with original, cleverly observational lyrics.What makes this film worth watching is Joaquin Phoenix, once again fully immersed in a troubled character.  When Phoenix steps into the role of Joker, his devotion to the role is absolute, his commitment is complete.  His presence is so commanding that the moviegoer simply can’t look away.  With the exception of Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight series, “Joker” soars high above the other films that have addressed this comic book series.  Some will even see elements of Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver” at various points.  Director Phillips clearly aspires to offer much more than most of the films in this franchise.  Because of Phoenix, he succeeds.    The fatal flaw for “Joker” is that it is a one-note tune.  In the vision of Writer/Director Todd Phillips, life is tedium interspersed with cruelty and violence, some of it random, some intentional.  With one small exception, any sense of kindness or human connection is just a hallucination.  In other words, apparently, it’s 42nd Street in New York City in the 1970s.Against this barren landscape, Phillips engages in a little social commentary – the impact of the disintegrating mental health safety net, the grinding consequences for most when they are caught in the ever-widening gap between rich and poor.  Clearly, these are topics with current relevance, but the subjects receive only glancing blows, not deep consideration.What’s more frustrating, though, is that the script assumes that offering a chronology of events about Joker eliminates any obligation to engage in actual character development.  We are given information about Joker’s tragic childhood, we observe him in his occupation as a low-level clown (in case we don’t get the point, the song “Send in the Clowns” is deployed to underline the idea), we see the consequences of his complete social isolation.  But, critically, we never see Joker evolve in any way.  He is no more self-aware than when the film begins.  He’s just a tragic character lurching from one day to the next, moving closer and closer to a boiling point, heading toward a conclusion as obvious as it is unfortunate.“Joker” is depressing, frustrating, upsetting, powerful and riveting.  You can’t take your eyes off Joaquin Phoenix and the spectacle he ultimately creates.  Sometimes, you may wish you had.… Expand",7,1,"Oct 12, 2019"

This film is shot and edited so marvellously and this is probably my favourite score of the year. However this movie does have its flaws and the first being it took way to long for the film to get into the meat of its story. For the first hour the film takes us in so many directions and introduces so many messages and themes that I struggled to identify what the film was trying to be. There were also some character decisions made that I didn't appreciate. I know Todd Phillips is trying to make something different compared to most comic book movies, but some of the decisions made to Jokers origin and how they treated some of the supporting characters bugged me. there's also a point where the film should have ended, but it didn't and another scene is added, instantly I knew the film should've ended when it did, the last 4 minutes make no sense and add an extra few minutes to the film that doesn't need to be there. Overall I did enjoy this movie, very fresh and I am glad we didn't just get another comic book movie with end of the world plots and big action scenes. Definitely a recommendation for all film lovers.… Expand",8,0,"Oct 13, 2019"

Is he a maniac created by an accidental fall into an acidic bath or is he a symptom of the society as a whole? Joker tries to answer these questions, while it also gives the audience an honest glimpse of our modern society, where the poor are forgotten and left in a system that is meant to keep taps on them more than help them.It is understandable why this movie has created so much controversy, because while it meant to be the backstory of Batman's arch-nemesis, it is firmly grounded in the reality and problems of today of today. problems that most people don't want to talk about or recognize.Because of this, and due in a large part to the stellar performance of Joaquin Phoenix, this movie deserves the highest of marks, no matter what the professional critics might think. The movie is just about two hours long, but time flies when you're having fun, and in my humble opinion this is a movie that everyone should watch.The best detail about this movie is the fact that it works perfectly as a standalone criticism of today's society, but it also works as a prequel to Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" from 2008, as it tells a plausible backstory to Heath Ledgers Joker.In short; this movie should be seen by all, and it should be rewarded with as many rewards as possible.… Expand",10,2,"Oct 13, 2019"

The ‘Joker’ is a disturbing movie. The storyline is easy to understand but there where a lot of inappropriate jokes. These jokes where for example: he just killed someone and he tells the other person that he’s a good guy and he will not get killed. Which made everything weird about the movie, also because people really thought it was funny. I think that it brings the wrong ideas to solve that problem (the rich stay rich, the poor stay poor).The actors and visuals are really good. That made it seems very realistic and also grose because when he killed someone I couldn’t watch it. It’s very uncomfortable to watch and afterwards the feeling haunted me. It wasn’t like an horror movie that you’re scared and people also pass away, it was just very different than that. It gave a weird feeling because there are people at the moment that think like him, which is kind of scary. I do not recommend to watch it. If you do wanna watch it, I would wait until it airs on tv, that way you don’t spend your money on it.… Expand",1,2,"Oct 13, 2019"

Ultimately, it’s just a silly superhero origin story, but it’s presented in such a ‘realist’ style, and so forcefully, that people might actually take it as a serious movie.  It has all the style and surface veneer of a classic 1970s movie, as has been pointed out by numerous reviewers.  Visually, it can’t be faulted for its cinematography.  It’s the script and characterisation that are lacking.  Nobody would go into a film based on a comic book expecting a serious character study, but, by tackling the genre in the style of such a movie, that is what you are falsely enticed to expect.  Unfortunately, that is not what you get.  The viewer is presented with a mentally ill man, living with his disabled mother, who becomes a deranged serial killer who incites mass violence.  This could have been an in-depth psychological exploration of one man’s descent into the maelstrom, that gives the viewer some insight into how a corrupt and insensitive society can push a vulnerable individual over the edge, as those well-known seventies movies did to some extent.  Such a narrative requires nuance, sensitivity, compassion and tact, or risk demonising the vulnerable.  The very lack of any of the aforementioned does just that – it sets back the mentally ill fifty years or more.  What we have here is a series of episodic vignettes – admittedly in the style of a comic book – in which, through a series of gross oversimplifications, the put-upon protagonist slowly loses his grip on reality and descends into graphic violence.  Each prior vignette is treated in such a superficial manner that they serve merely as lame justification for the gory set pieces.Joaquin Phoenix’s performance is intense and physical, but, in the absence of any human depth, proves to be nothing more than a leering caricature.  Lingering, over-stylised shots of his manic posturing does not equate to a meaningful performance, however fully the actor has thrown himself into the part.  Instead, when the movie reaches its riotous denouement, rather than a criticism of the society that led to his downfall, we are presented with a film that seems to celebrate and encourage the very ills that incites his violence.  Points of comparison are ‘Assassination Nation’ and, to a lesser extent, ‘Spring Breakers’.  It is this very confusion, simultaneously vilifying the vulnerable and championing them as an anarchic anti-hero, undercutting the capitalist ruling class, that serves to further stigmatise the mentally ill.  At the risk of sounding alarmist, younger viewers - older teenagers and those in their early twenties - the very audience that such a film is aimed at, or anyone else with a naïve lack of understanding of mental health, for that matter, could come away from this movie with less empathy for the isolated and marginalised than they went in, thinking the film is cool, when it’s far from that.  For that reason, it is reckless and misjudged, but what should we expect from the director of puerile frat movie ‘Old School’ and laddy stag film ‘The Hangover’?… Expand",3,2,"Oct 13, 2019"

The newest installment of DC’s Joker is a revelation!In a world surrounded by so much social issues and one sidedness, this movie shines a light in a most controversial direction.Say hello to Arthur Fleck, a man that has been put in the same social grinder in which many Americans find themselves in today. Abandoned, abused, humiliated for the sake of ratings and ultimately judged for unluckily being the final cog in a corrupt unsympathetic system.You can literally see Arthur Fleck grow and slowly transition into one of the most iconic and challenging villains ever thought up.At one point in time Arthur writes something on a piece of stationary that literally made my eyes open and my heart sink into my throat.“The worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't.”In no other point in history would a movie and saying like this have struck a nerve so intensely than now.The joker shows a point of view that we rarely get to see. It shows us the role many of us play in the lives of those that suffer in ways we could only imagine. It does what many directors are too afraid to do, it says what many people will never admit to saying.That in the world of the mentally ill, many times... we are the monsters. Our abusive nature breaths life into the jokers of our time and we cannot remove ourselves from their process of birth.Phoenix gives a moving performance as only a man that has seen his level of troubled life could deliver. He fills each scene with peculiar movements and if I may be so bold, gives us the Joker we always knew loved behind the paint.As a long time watcher of DC animated movies one will find deep appreciation and even nostalgia in the movements, the running/ sliding and the laughs that have become permanently attached to this most infamous villain. I personally believe that this is the best Joker yet and that no one will be able to give this level of performance again. Bravo DC! This was desperately needed. Not only for the DC universe but for 2019. You may agree with my opinion... you may disagree... and that is what makes everything about a movie like this relevant.

I loved joker. It is a nice change of pace from all the other comic book movies. It isn’t over the top action like avengers, it is more realistic and more violent. From the start you are hooked and can connect with Arthur. You want to feel sympathy for him, but as the movie goes on you may start to feel less and less sympathetic for him because of the choices he makes. The climax of the movie is very satisfying yet very dark, you feel good for Arthur but you don’t want to. The ending is also very good, it lets you choose what parts of the movie are real and what parts are just Arthur’s hallucinations or fantasies.

It was interesting to see the Joker get a standalone film. I feel as if people over hyped the film not to say it was bad. There were some scenes in the film that felt unnecessary but what made it worth it was exposure of Arthur's mentality. The idea of having a monster come from a society that is supposed to be normal was exceptional. The constant laughing was somewhat annoying though I'd let that slide. Another thing worth mentioning was Arthur killing his adoptive mother, it wasn't dramatic enough. I will give the writers praise for how Thomas Wayne and Arthur met, simply gold. I understand that most of the way how the character was used wasn't based from the comics but it's fun to see things from a different perspective. If there is a sequel to be intact in the future, moving the storyline from the comics wouldn't be bad as long as it's not too far from the source.… Expand",6,1,"Oct 13, 2019"

The Joker has always been one of my favorite comic book characters. I've always known Joaquin Phoenix to be a phenomenal actor so I was interested to see what he could bring to the character. After watching the film, I can't explain the amount of disappointment I felt. The movie itself is an incredibly slow burn that takes quite a bit of patience to endure. This movie is extremely loosely connected to the Batman mythos and that is putting it mildly. The title of the film is probably the only thing ""Joker"" about this movie. The film portrays itself as a deep, methodical view on mental health struggles and how society treats those that struggle from them. This would have been a better film if it was not in any way connected to the comic character. Not basing this portrayal on any story from the comics was a very bold move and one that made me worried and rigtfully so it would seem. The movie doesn't really know what kind of story it wants to tell. I wouldn't call this an origin story since Arthur Fleck is in no way the Joker that we all know and love. He is like the Party City version of the beloved character. Imagine if some fanboy tried to emulate what being the joker is like for college film project and that's what you get with this film. I felt like I had wasted two hours watching this disaster. The only bright spot in this movie would be Phoenix's acting. He did the best with what the script gave him.… Expand",3,2,"Oct 14, 2019"

I really don't understand why it's considered a masterpiece. The only actor in this film that does an excellent job is Phoenix, giving an awesome, gripping, Oscar worthy performance. Aside from that, the film is missing another 30 minutes of character development for Arthur Fleck at least. His transition is too quick. That said, this isn't the Joker. It's a 21st century rendition of Taxi Driver, designed to make loads of cash by having Joker's image plastered all over. The rioting makes no sense, and cannot be excused by having someone say ""It's Gotham so it makes sense."" The idea that the media would put a murder of three businessmen on the front pages and give it such a wide coverage in an already murder-infested town of Gotham barely makes any sense. Also, easily one of the worst things about this film is, they spoiled ALL of the ""epic"" lines in the trailers. The script isn't really anything to make you amazed or perk your eyebrows. It kind of seems that the director had a good vision, but got lazy halfway into the making of this film.

And violence per se is not usually a problem for critics and media, or the real reason behind the controversies surrounding this movie. There is plenty of movies that have critical acclaim despite the fact they are glorifying violence.Their problem seems to be in the fact that Joker is more than just a story of a villain committing acts of violence. It's also a genuine portrayal of a society in decay. This movie shows us what broken society does to people living in it. It's a psychological study of people not just on individual level. Also a movie full of plot twists which make you question what we see, trying to make you think about it and recognize deception from reality.That's why media and some acclaimed critics are targeting Joker, labeling the movie as dangerous. Well, at least those who understand the movies underlying implications. There are many critics who are just condemning the movie from a very superficial standpoint or even without seeing it, just blindly embracing the narrative created around it. Joker is, apart from its multiple messages it tries to convey to us, also a beautifully made piece of cinematography done on a relatively low budget.

There were two police officers on hand, but it was a very calm and peaceful evening. The theater was completely full and there were a lot of people who clapped and even cried during the movie. However, not once did I ever fear for my safety or my life. Never once did I feel or sense there was going to be anarchy, chaos, or a riot after the movie. IT WAS JUST A MOVIE. Just like any other action movie with guns, violence, and killing in it (F&F, John Wick, etc., etc.). All in all, I thought 2019's Joker was a great movie is a masterpiece with an oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Pheonix. It was a very human movie. It show's a man who's been broken down, beaten, lied to, and mistreated his whole life. A man who feels isolated, alone, unwanted, and unloved in a system and society completely against him. Because of the way the film is portrayed and because of the incredible talent of Joaquin Phoenix, you can empathize and sympathize with his character. You feel sorry for him and all of the incredibly unjust bs he goes through. You may even find yourself wishing you could help him. Because of that, you can understand his descent into madness and the reason behind all of his characters' actions (not that they were wholly just or correct by any means). It gave depth and insight into the Joker's and Batman's (Bruce Wayne's) relationship and their history as a prequel movie. The ONLY things I can think of why certain groups of people might be against this movie are: 1) They don't like DC Comics or Batman. 2) They don't like Joaquin Phoenix as an actor. 3) They're afraid that the movie will empower self-righteous people who are fed-up with a corrupt government into taking action and causing Anarchy (like in the movie). 4) They think that grown adults don't have any common sense and/or general reasoning skills, can't distinguish between reality and fiction, and cannot control their own thoughts and actions.

An interesting film to think about and worth watching for the cultural factor alone. We know that Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is the Joker and this is his origin film so I won't talk about the outline of the plot in chronological order. The club scenes where he is laughing at the wrong times and he cannot tell his own jokes later on for his uncontrollable laughter are some of the most compelling scenes in the film. The production values were all good as you would expect from a big studio picture. I liked the approach of making the film darker and grittier than your standard comic book movie, you really felt as if Gotham was this volcanic cesspit ready to erupt. The buildup of the revolution with the talk of garbage everywhere and the government closing Arthur's program down and cutting his medication, his 'crazy' mother Penny Fleck (Frances Conroy), this makes the altercation on the train where he kills the guys all the more understandable and real. Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) calling the lower class clowns, I can see an outcry but this definitely felt overblown for me with how they then viewed the subway killings and this clown figure which is Arthur as some messiah for them to follow and rebel against the upper class. I did like how Thomas Wayne appeared less like this benevolent god as he is always seemingly portrayed though.However, the film felt very predictable and soulless for me. I didn't believe that Arthur and Thomas Wayne were related because his mother was obviously mentally disturbed and Frances Conroy is the stereotypical unstable or strange woman (Six Feet Under' and 'American Horror Story'). There was every chance they were related however with the inscription on the back of the photo of Penny by ""T.W"", either way the question becomes irrelavant because we know Arthur is an unreliable narrator and his path has been set because it is a film about the Joker's origins so it had to be this way. The worst parts of the movie were with Sophie Dumond (Zazie Beetz) but not because of her perfromance, she performed as well as anyone in the film, it was a solid ensemble performance but she was let down with a poor screenplay as were the rest of the cast. They showed Arthur was delusional before his encounters with Sophie and you are expected to believe they embrace in her doorway and after his laughing fit at the comedy club, she is seen a short while after laughing with him? It was far too obvious. but it is meant to be a big revelation that he imagined it, of course he did, he is a creep.The biggest thing for me is I felt as if I was watching some 'Taxi Driver'-'The King of Comedy' mish mash to the point where it was not its own film for me. I thought the whole time that I would rather be watching those films and whilst I largely liked the final act, it was again so obvious that Arthur was going to kill Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) to the point where I lost interest almost completely and I was not overwhelmed by some euphoric cinematic cruscendo of a moment when it happened, because it was typical. Arthur gets his chaos anyway and it is a decent character arc, they should have ended the film with the scene before Arthur is running around the corridors because where Arthur says something along the lines of ""You wouldn't get it"" in the room with the woman and then the song comes on, that was the perfect time to end it, that was very good. I had mixed feelings on showing Bruce Wayne's (Dante Pereira-Olson) parents being killed, simply because I have seen it so many times but I guess it was an alright idea to connect it to Arthur's character arc. I don't think Joker needed an origin film and this should be a mystery aka 'The Dark Knight', this is not to say I went into the film with an automatic disliking for the film because the film did have its merits and I love to keep an open mind to every film obviously, I just did not see the point of this film before going in and I largely feel the same after seeing the film. 'Logan' did for me what this film could not, a dark comic book film that felt like it was its own thing. I do not think I could give it more than a six being truthful, it does not resonate with me but its foundations are solid. I would forget the hype it has got but I would also especially forget the people criticising the violence. There are more violent films that have been made and that will be made, it is 2019 and we do not need the incessant attempts by people in the media industry who are saying that forms of media, e.g. Video Games, Films, TV shows, Podcasts and so on are directly responsible for every violent or illegal act committed. The evidence proves it is quite the contrary and it is a minority of already disturbed individuals in most cases.… Expand",6,4,"Oct 15, 2019"

This movie deserves the world! I cannot even express how much i enjoyed watching it! I am so ready to give it a second go and watch it again, in order to analyze all the details that I've missed! This movie sheds light upon mental illness, especially how childhood abuse influences your adult life and how society can actually turn you into a monster. It shows the involution of Arthur and how his tragic life develops and transforms into a comedy, driving him into complete madness. The movie shows the differences between the poor and the rich and shows the struggles of the real world. This movie is real, it is a psychological action drama that shows us how raw humanity is and what the consequences of untreated mental illness can lead to. This does not at all provoke anyone to start being violent or dress up as clowns and riot the streets. This makes the viewer analyze his own life, analyze his own moral values and realize for themselves what is right, what is wrong, what is good, what is evil. Joaquin Phoenix brought justice for the Joker, as I haven't seen such a good Joker since Heath Ledger's outstanding performance. Joaquin Phoenix, an actor that definitely deserves an Oscar, perfectly portrayed an unstable Arthur and a crazy Joker, that, in the end, were combined and became only one. His movements, facial expressions, tonality of voice, were sublime and brought mystery, darkness and truth to us all.In the end, you won't know anymore what is real and what is not, as the enigmatic ending plays with your mind and leaves you with numerous unanswered questions.… Expand",10,0,"Oct 15, 2019"

I heard mixed reviews on this film however I had to see for myself, and I am giving this film and eight. A hard to stomach production as we dive into the character we all know as The Joker. Growing up off of DC, we as the viewers are so accustomed to the playful yet hazardous cartoon character. There have been many times where we catch glimpses of the Dark-side the Joker portrays. That being said this film truly grasps the realism and humanity this very troubled being has to offer. Misunderstood and deeply disturbed. I could see how they were mixed reviews I neither love the character noor hated the character... but rather understood The ramifications. The unfortunate fact is, this film may have you truly cringing as you take a journey into to the mind of the Joker.

The pictures are awesome, the music fits perfectly. I think that the interpretation of the Joker's laugh is really original. The idea of a sad Joker whose laugh does not show happiness is for me the more interesting Joker. A sad, complicated character who does not even plan to be a criminal. The circumstances lead him to his true path in life. His tics, his moves, his behavior as a whole built a true crazy character. The dance moves in the film add some extra beauty to his performance. Heath Ledger (another near-perfect performance of the Clown prince of crime) was to me too conscious. He had so many plans and shemes, he had opinions about the society and plans how to test it and this I feel is not typicall for a crazy person. I like the weaknesses of this Joker. The crazy little tics he shows throughout the film. You can see that he is actually a sick man not just because he kills people. The messege is nothing new for the film industy - the little man who is neglected by the society. That is why I gave it 9, not 10. When it comes to comparing the Ledger and the Phoenix interpretation of the Joker I think there are two viewpoints. Some would prefer the Joker to be the apex predator in Gotham, forcing everybody to kneel before him. I prefer the Joker being crazy, emotional, sometimes weak and vulnerable and sad.

Outstanding performance by Joaquin Phoenix. You really feel this character. Anyone who has ever been picked on or feels the world is against them will relate more. The message should be clear on how some people don't realize how badly they treat others. We live in a world where sometimes people are so wrapped up in themselves they don't care about another human being's feelings. For me I found myself on the Joker's side. I felt pain for his pain. He has just been kicked down over and over again. He feels that life is just nasty and short and nobody cares?! The human race is bad. Joaquin Phoenix does an incredible job of conveying that vulnerability and rage. With the mood swings and crazy laugh it's hard to imagine that you want him to be the hero not a villain. In his mind he is the hero ridding the world of cruel people. There have been several very different portrayals of the Joker in other movies but by far Joaquin Phoenix is in a class of his own. A dark character that you feel sympathy and empathy for. He's aware a monster is evolving inside of him and he struggles with it before releasing it. Overall this is a solid movie with a lot of darkness and depth and Joaquin Phoenix definitely deserves an award for the best performance I have seen in a very long time.… Expand",10,0,"Oct 15, 2019"
Danny10474,"Personally I really liked the movie.

It took a somewhat predictable and flat character as the Joker of the comic books that he can't seem to escape from the stereotype of the psychopath mastermind who causes chaos for no apparent reason at all. This leads to an empty plot and it shows a great indifference for the struggles of a person with a mental disorder. On the other hand Arthur Fleck seems a much more relatable figure. He is a person who struggles with his mental illness and who is trying his best to fit into the world. He tries to become one with the crowd and to feel connected with the others, while society seems to never care about him or other individuals that are a bit different than the normal. The Gotham city is appeared to be a dystopia where great social struggles take place. The rich remain rich and the poor must live in the isolation, the crime and the fear of survival. There is no providence for their lives and their health and most of them live in misery.  Everyone is at the point where they want to rebel against a machine that only works for the rich. Everyone lives a life that is almost unbearable and this is portrayed through Arthur. Arthur tries his best to be a good person, to live a normal life and to make his dream even if it's hopeless to come true. His mental illness is very severe and the state doesn't seem to care at all for people like him. Essentially he is all alone in a world where he is considered a freak that can easily turn to a scapegoat. With this kind of indifference and isolation the character develops and falls little by little into madness. It's the society's ways that committed the crime before Arthur did it himself. At this point the movie builds a lot into the character of Joker and gives him a certain depth to realize that he isn't a farfetched character, but a normal person who suffered and was pushed to crime by an estranged society that cheers the social differences. I like how the movie plays with the layers of truth from the start till the very end. I like how everything seems to lead to a certain structure and then this structure is being destroyed as if to portray how a human can feel deconstructed by the coldness of his surrounding environment. I believe that the movie is essentially social and makes us all feel a little more sympathy for people with mental illness as well as contemplate on our way of life and the dangers the system may hide. The clown uprising in the town is nothing but the eruption of accumulated misery in a society where only the rich can flourish, while the poor are always being neglected and walked upon. It's not the first time that someone even a murderer becomes an idol for his actions when such social struggles take place and this is what makes this movie real. The actors were all amazing, the cinematography was breathtaking, the protagonist is simply brilliant and the plot is essentially deep and meaningful. I like all the associations the plot can enable with sociology, psychology, literature and history. I love to see the building of a character and I find that certain scenes were simply amazing and ingenious. One of them must be the Joker meeting young Bruce. We don't have two mortal enemies there, but a troubled man who wants to find the truth who tries not to scare of a little boy. Yes he is manipulative towards him but at the same time he has nothing against him and throughout the movie we see that Arthur was very friendly towards the children. It gave me chills to see their interaction to be so friendly and simple knowing that later on they will be enemies. I really liked the idea to connect the arc of Joker with Bruce's loss of his parents since it shows that in reality we don't have a black and white picture but many shades of gray in between. Every action has a reaction and even if the first seems right to one there's always a different perspective. The same applies with the reality. Some choose to see the story of Joker to be nothing but a joke he made while he was talking with his psychiatrist (as to say a very pessimistic and nihilistic turn to what makes us humans) but at the same time someone can read this scene differently. All of his story could easily happen and it makes a lot of sense according with what we saw to feel sorry and a certain sympathy for this troubled character. Yet everyone seems to forget it all again after the force of the system takes down the uprising. All of these events didn't bring the change he wanted to see, didn't make him more lovable to the crowd didn't give him the happiness he was searching, rather he is portrayed as the villain and the society seems to return to point zero..… Expand",9,0,"Oct 15, 2019"

Because of thisJoker is a wonderfully crafted movie depicting the plight of Arthur Fleck and how he is betrayed by the system and people of his society. Arthur Fleck has a mental illness. Anyone with any sensory functions can see this. Because of this character trait, the media have stirred up controversy over this character because of how he is portrayed. Joker is not some ""incel guide"" to teach mentally disturbed white men how to become violent menaces, it's a deep and captivating story about someone who struggles with mental issues and is belittled for his condition. The reason why these so called ""critics"" and media outlets **** on this movie is because they are afraid of facing reality. This kind of thing happens in real life all the time. Not everyone with a mental illness becomes a mass killer, but when someone is failed by the system and everyone around them, there is a potential risk of creating a monster. The movie is not the problem, it is the people that constantly throw the blame on external factors, when in reality it is the fault of themselves. I felt for Arthur Fleck and could empathize with his past and situation. It's hard to watch this movie and not want to go through the screen and give him a hug, lend him an ear to listen, or to find him a better therapist. I am in no way justifying his actions, because they are cruel and unforgivable. But it's hard not to empathize with someone who has been spat down on their entire life, with no hope of recovery whatsoever. If you go into this movie expecting a family friendly cake walk, then you're in for a wild surprise. It is rated R for a reason. It deals with themes that are surprisingly real and raw.

Phoenix's performance is brilliant, full of hurt and pathos while managing to be sympathetic. Phillips' direction is mostly tight and stylish.And while the movie generally plays how the trailers suggested, it still manages to be powerful, to be moving, to be affecting.It's a difficult watch at times, but the few moments of humor, though dark, land quite well. Watch it and reflect. This is a movie that perfectly encapsulates the current political climate despite being apolitical. It is not pushing for violence (not is it condemning it, per se). It is not praising Incel culture. It is none of the things most of the media suggest.Rather, Joker is a movie about pain, mental health, abandonment, austerity, and class warfare. In other words, a near-perfect movie for our time.… Expand",9,1,"Oct 16, 2019"

Its direction and photography are really pleasing and excellent. Joaquin Phoenix acting is spectacular. And it's a powerful competitor for the Best Actor in a Leading Role and the movie itself for the Best Picture award. When I saw this movie it remembered me a lot to Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976) due to its cinematic references to the classic. It was definitely worth the money and time. And after years of a lot of superhero movies coming from Marvel Studios, this one comes (in my opinion) as a very needful type of movie these days. A serious, dark, with a bit of funny moments movie. To see Arthur Fleck A.K.A. Joker, (Joaquin Phoenix) transform from a relatively ""normal"" guy to a crazy, obscure man because of all the revelations and life problems he has to go through, is just, as mentioned before, brilliant.

The movie is just awesome...it nails the comic book genre of movies. Never in the movie I thought that it is justifying the acts of Joker. His gradual descent into madness is gripping and full of surprises. There are some flaws in the movie cause no movie is a masterpiece. The Batman origin connection was surprising and a bit clumsy too. But the movie really does a good job. Joaquin is phenomenal and the direction by Todd Phillips is to the point. Lastly the movie makes you think about our society and the class division. It's social message is clear. It tells about mental illness and the child abuse. The movie's message and art is brought to life by Joaquin phoenix. He will hold you and never let you leave his grief and his belief. Definitely an Oscar worthy performance.In the last scene the fully fledged joker is dancing on a wrecked police car. Symbolising whenever law is at its loose end(symbolised by the wrecked police car) a joker is born i.e. an evil entity is born. When society is damaged joker is born.

The reviews are highly polarised.  Before I heard people saying that you will either really love the Joker, or really hate it. As someone who has been looking forward to the film ever since seeing the first trailer, finally yesterday I made my journey to the cinema and had a taste of the actual film. Well, in the end, I neither really love it nor hate it. If I have to describe my feeling, I would probably say…disappointed. So what is the Joker about? To sum up, it is a story about the absurdism of life, the death of hope, the absence of meaning, moral nihilism, political anarchy, and a celebration of chaos expressed and executed in an ultimate aesthetic ways via cinematic languages along with some of the most oppressive music I’ve heard in recent films. Much of these themes, if not all, reflect the fatal problematics of our post-modernist societies and cultures who envision the contemporary world as “an age of spiritual deficiency.”  I don’t have any problems with films with a realist stand trying to explore the downfalls of our culture, society, and complexity of humanities. Actually I think that this is what good cinema should do. My problem with the Joker is exactly that it didn’t do any of these. Don’t get me wrong. I still think the Joker is a great art. Joaquin Phoenix’s acting is absolutely fantastic, the music and cinematography breathtaking. But it’s still poor character-writing in which the complexity of humanity is reduced to its pitiful negativities, as in the Joker, everyone is sick, mean and evil. The ones who see or believe in something good in life are either insane (Arthur’s mother and Arthur himself) or hypocritical (the upper-class men). The former was ridiculed and labeled funny, the latter only harvested social grudge. It is a sad movie. What is even sadder is the media sensation around the movie. Before the movie was marketed as an antithesis of the mainstream commercial films in the superhero genre. It is meant to be a “sub-culture,” a non-commercial thing. But ironically, look at it now! It is very much MAINSTREAM. Chatting with a friend who lamented over “the degradation of contemporary culture,” I also can’t stop thinking—what kind of society are we living in? What kind of mentality do our mass viewers have in order to “enjoy” and even “empathize” with such a depressing film? To give a final remark, I think the Joker is, although probably against its own will, a successful commercial popcorn movie, because there is no much there beyond the overwhelming sensual experience it evokes. Nevertheless, if one does think it is in any way different and more special than other commercial popcorn films, it is special only because it makes you feel so uneasy that you could hardly swallow any popcorns while watching it.… Expand",5,4,"Oct 19, 2019"

There were a few plot holes and the story simply wasn't engaging enough. It's like they try make you empathic to the protagonist by showing you his run of bad luck and fortune but he actually rides it pretty well.The bouts of ultra violence are sporadic yet seem forced. Ultimately, the portrayal of how his psychosis manifests is not believable. If the movie was just called ""Fleck"" i wouldn't have bothered.

I understood that it was taking a different approach, doing it's own thingFrom the pitch trailer where Joaquin Phoenix donned the make up, and the trailers that followed after. Joker easily became one of my most anticipated films of 2019. I understood that it was taking a different approach, doing it's own thing outside of the Extended DC Universe. Reality can be a cruel mistress, along with life not being all sunshine and rainbows. It's unfortunate and sometimes we need movies to help us see that things can get crazier, it's unsettling though brutally beautiful there's no denying that. I'm not glorifying violence, though unfortunately when society, and communities fall. It's bound to happen, it's not going to be a light subject. It's going to be dark, grim, and dirty. Each kill or violent act we can see the madness growing until it reaches it's crescendo. To see the journey towards madness unfold with every inconvenience, every emotional breakdown it's heartbreaking, unpleasant, and it just makes you feel unnerved. Those aren't exactly bad traits for the performances just sell it. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a hauntingly painful display, we can see a broken man just scatter and rebuild into something more sinister. When all hope is lost, what more do you have to give? Zazie Beets as Sophie also did a great job with her role, acting as one of the few hope spots for poor Arthur, and De Niro playing a talk show host who might be a slimeball for his ridicule is no slouch either.… Expand",10,2,"Oct 19, 2019"

After hearing great things about it which indicated that it wouldn’t be at all like I originally expected, I decided to see the film.Arthur Fleck is so unlike previous incarnations of the Joker that it’s insulting to even consider him to be the same character. Instead of another badly written, disgusting, and monstrous überedgelord, we got a believable, lifelike, and compelling character who barely resembles the Joker. To put it more simply, other Jokers are characters written  for edgelords, while Arthur is a realistic portrayal of an edgelord.The film reflects America’s current fears of political violence, violent mobs, and spree killers. Arthur is white, male, mentally ill, has become misanthropic due to feeling that society has abused and abandoned him, and seeks attention from committing atrocities, all of which are common traits among today’s spree killers. The film is not an endorsement of violence, but an exploration of the mindset of a killer. The film is very melodramatic, but that isn’t a bad thing. Each incident that pushes Arthur further into evil is reminiscent of situations that inspire real life violence, not to endorse the violent acts, but to explain the motives behind them. A film tackling a question of “why” these acts of violence happen is needed in an age where they seem to happen so often.Part of the reason that Black Panther was good was because it greatly distanced itself from the shared universe that it was part of. Joker takes this further by distancing itself from the entire superhero genre. In fact, the only reason that this is a superhero movie are a few place and character names that could’ve been changed without impacting the plot, but as nice as it would be, a major studio would never put so much money and effort into a film like this unless it was tied to a lucrative franchise like DC/Batman. I’ve previously said that Black Panther is the only superhero film that deserves to be nominated for an Oscar other than Best Visual Effects, but I believe that not only does Joker also deserve to be nominated in several Oscar categories, it possibly even deserves to win them. Like how I expect Black Panther to be a fluke for Marvel, I expect Joker to be a fluke for DC, being the one example of the company making a good film despite the odds.Talking about the film’s context and comparing it to other works doesn’t really capture everything that went into making this movie good. The cinematography was better than any film I’ve seen recently, with most shots seeming to be carefully and deliberately constructed, the original score is haunting and sets the mood perfectly, dialogue is consistently well written, the actors do a great job of bringing the characters to life, and every scene stands out as memorable and potential classics. Overall, a very well made film.9/10… Expand",9,1,"Oct 20, 2019"

MADJohn,"Joker's incredible box-office hit is not without a certain irony for a film that is so inspired by the new Hollywood.The new Hollywood is this period of American filmmaking, where filmmakers start making small and medium-budget films thatJoker's incredible box-office hit is not without a certain irony for a film that is so inspired by the new Hollywood.The new Hollywood is this period of American filmmaking, where filmmakers start making small and medium-budget films that are part of a counter-culture, in stark contrast to the Pharaonic budgets of the big Hollywood machines of previous years, and achieve unexpected public successes for this kind of film, leading to a whole decade where audiences rush to the cinema to see films where ""people in suits talk in the dark"", to use Coppola's famous phrase to describe the Godfather.Given the success of Todd Philips's reasonably priced film compared to recent blockbusters, it is hoped that this joker will pave the way for a ""Hollywood renewal"".Joker even opens with the old Warner logo (the one used from 1972 to 1984), immediately marking the dark aesthetics typical of those years, and unfolds as a study of character that is reminiscent of some films of the period like Midnight Cowboy (a film filled with losers who are not without Arthur Fleck) but especially two films by Martin Scorsese: Taxi Driver at the King of Comedy (de Niro taking Lewis's place).But the film is not just a nostalgic trip back to a bygone era, so much so that its subject is rooted in our time by talking about the ever-increasing disparity between rich and poor, by pinpointing the current political and economic discourse of the elites through the figure of Thomas Wayne, who resembles to be mistaken for a clever mix of Trump and Macron.The film, in an obvious parallel with the society in which we live, holds out a mirror and pushes the nail down: cuts in social assistance budgets and a whole section of the society that has been abandoned will inevitably end up generating all kinds of abominations on the fertile ground that is poverty.It is quite striking to note the similarities between the demonstrations of the Gotham subjects dressed as clown, and other mass citizen movements that can be observed in France or elsewhere at this time.Nevertheless, beyond the question of society's collective responsibility in creating its own monsters, the film is more about studying a character who is going mad than about burning politics.And what a character! Joaquin Phoenix masters his subject and is as touching in some scenes as he is disturbing in others, and we feel as much empathy for him as we do disgust.And then, this laugh, which seems to physically hurt Arthur Fleck and which is an essential part of the role's panoply, this laugh, is particularly well found and defines the character perfectly, not the joker in general, but the joker in particular.In short, a role to the disproportionate size of this talented actor.In the end, Joker is a successful film, even if it is not without some flaws or elements that are sometimes too heavily endorsed both in its content and its staging. And while it is true that I am less enthusiastic than the average, I am delighted with the success of a film that places characters above effects and that we hope to see emulators in the future.… Expand",10,1,"Oct 21, 2019"

MattBrady99,"There’s something beautifully hypnotic about Joaquin Phoenix.Everytime I try to figure out why, but nothing will come closer to the answer. How lucky are we to go to the cinema and watch one of the greatest livings actors of our generationThere’s something beautifully hypnotic about Joaquin Phoenix.Everytime I try to figure out why, but nothing will come closer to the answer. How lucky are we to go to the cinema and watch one of the greatest livings actors of our generation in his prime giving us a performance that we will never forget. Joaquin Phoenix was absolutely phenomenal as Arthur Fleck, or his stage name ‘Joker’. Some of the best acting I’ve seen all year.Phoenix lost a staggering 50 Pounds for the role and there’s plenty of scenes where we see his whole body in frame. You literally see every bone in this guys body, and at times it makes him look ghoulish. Oddly shaped and mangled. With his shoulder blades in clear sight, you could metaphorically say he’s an angel fallen to hell after losing his wings, or something like that. When he laughs I feel his pain, because the character has a mental condition where he has episodes of uncontrollable laughter that doesn’t reflect his actual mood. A real life condition that’s so awful to imagine. Phoenix can act with his eyes where you see the pain and anxiety from Arthur's mental state.Whenever Arthur feels like he’s in control of something in his life, he dances. There’s a bathroom scene where we first see his dance, which looks a lot like Tai chi while displaying such power. Its also when darkness started to crawl into his soul. Something so simple can speak more than a million words. And what’s more impressive he completely improvised that scene. I like when directors let actors play around.I felt sorry for Arthur, not because I related to him or I saw myself in him, but because Phoenix is that brilliant of an actor that you struggle to pick a side to root for or against. Despite the questionable and straight up horrific acts he commits, but you understand how he got to this point and it dawns on you how much of a tragedy it is.‘Joker’ has already divided people like no movie ever. People say the movie is empty and has nothing to say. I don’t agree, because the message is loud and clear - don’t be a dick to your fellow neighbor. Todd Philips never intended to make a political statement, but to hold up a mirror to reflect the ugliness in people and the filth in our “improved” society.When I heard that Todd Philips was going to be directing, I thought it made perfect sense. Just watch the ‘Hangover 2 & 3’, the two most uncomfortable comedies he’s ever directed that felt more crime drama than anything funny. There’s also some dark humor in ‘Joker’ that involves a door chain. It’s silly, yet absolutely terrifying with the given context. A complete departure from his other work and that’s why I think it’s one of his best. I honestly think he made something so unique and meaningful. Seriously, I do.The score by Hildur Guðnadóttir helped set the tone tremendously. A melancholy tone with a chaotic twist. A representation of Arthur slowly drowning in his own misery and pain. A little fun fact: The score for the film were written based on the script even before the actual filming of the movie started, which I think is the best way to do it, if you ask me. Someone to imagine movie by songs and incorporate their interpretation through music.The cinematography was gorgeous and there’s a handful of shots that has imprinted into my memory. Lawrence Sher does an excellent job off showing the decaying Gotham city and the sewer waste look of the city. Bright neon lights with striking colors that manage to make the most run down of places look pretty.I like how they actually gave Thomas Wayne a character rather than “guy gets shot in alleyway”. He’s portrayed as a ruthless man with blunt ways of saving Gotham City. However he loves his wife and son, so his unforgiving attitude was all for the shake of keeping his loved ones safe. He’s also a massive movie buff where he often goes to watch the classics on the big screen. So it’s an interesting take on the character viewed in somebody’s else perspective.Now lets talk about the controversy that's been surrounding this movie:This is one of the most ludicrous controversy in recent memory. The movie will not cause or inspire violence, but shows why violence happens. Maybe this movie could inspire people to think twice about how they treat others. Why not think about the positives? If “Joker” is going to be responsible for violence and mass shootings, then so is every other movie with any form of violence ever. And sure, there’s some brutal and raw approach to violence in ‘Joker’, but we all have seen worst. ‘Deadpool’ is more graphic than this. It's not the directors duty to teach morals to the viewer. People will never learn to stop pointing fingers at things to blame and actually do something about it! People often understandment how much power their got.Anywhere, sorry about that folks, just had to get that off my chest. Go and check it out.… Expand",7,2,"Oct 21, 2019"

It felt like it made sense. As for Phoenix, my god that man can act. He managed to convey an entire spectrum of emotions. You can see the tears in his eyes as he laughs, seeing the pain that Arthur feels. Or when he laughs at Murray's body, its as if Phoenix enjoyed the scene.

His direction was crafty and pretty awesome though lack a little bit of originality. His trick with Arthur's illusion seemed a bit risky given its context. We will never know for sure if Arthur did go Murray's show or not!The cinematography was superb, there were plenty of scenes that'll enter your mind and stay there for a while.Joaquin Phoenix did his best, tried hard to embody the magnanimous character of Joker, he did pretty well, but sometimes it felt he was just trying too hard. Despite it's unfair to compare him with great heath ledger I must say he was able to pull it off impressively and takes this Joker to a distinct level. It was a one-man show and he's gonna get nominated for the academy award for sure.One of the most entertaining and satisfying aspects of this film is its music composition, damn! It was too good, and you'll get to see some insane dance move as a bonus.The main problem with this film is the lack of originality and a precise plot, sometimes it felt like the movie itself was confused and wandering aimlessly!

You feel Bruse Wayne's pain and love for the city. You sense the necessity of sacrifice of such social elites to save the city. Joker, on the other hand, tells the story from an entirely different angle. You get to see Gotham from the point of view of a commoner, who struggles at his day to day life, just like all the other commoners, struck by recession, having little to rely on, cheating and hurting others on daily basis just to get by. You get to see the City from the eyes of people who are routinely looked down upon by the Elite, either as trash, or as someone to be ""changed"" or ""saved"".One suggestion for the viewer who is going to watch this movie:Although from the surface level, the Gotham and the people portrayed in this movie might feels different from the impression you got from Batman movies. Remember that you are looking at the world from the perspective of the Joker. Watch with your existing understandings on those familiar characters in mind. Try and understand the contradictions that you see. Enjoy the movie with this mind set, you will end up with a much deeper appreciation over this piece of art.Joker is, with no doubt, a dark movie, as what a movie named as Joker should be. Yet with the dark story, it intrigues deep contemplation. Moreover, the social problem this movie portrays actually reflects the ever growing conflicts and dissonance in multiple parts of our contemporary world on many interesting levels.

The Joker is an entertaining movie and its depiction of the titular character was compelling from begging to end.  Joaquin Phoenix's performance was outstanding and will be remembered as on of the better Joker performances. Unfortunately, the movie falls flat when it comes to its themes and what it wants to say.It seems like it wants us to be on the side of the working class. After all, the joker is a working class man who's issues are exacerbated by the upperclass. The government cut funding to mental health services, leaving him without his therapist and medication. Thomas Wayne seems uncaring and critical of the poor and even his celebrity hero made jokes at his expense.  Following the Joker's actions, you can see how the class divide came to a head with the working class finally having enough of the oppression of the upper class and want social change.However, this falls apart when you consider the actions of the Joker and rioters. The Joker, while more sympathetic in this iteration, is still a psychopathic killer and he is propped up as the hero of the working class. The working class started rioting and one even murders the Waynes in the alley as a form of revenge on the upper class. If the film wants us to take the side of the working class as the ones being taken advantage of, it failed.  The upperclass were **** but the working class are dangerous criminals. This isn't helped by the fact that the movie showed the murder of the Waynes. We all know what will become of young Bruce. He becomes the hero of Gotham.  He is also the top 1% Billionaire playboy. So eventually the hero of Gotham will be a rich man saving Gotham from people like his parent's murderer, who happens to be a poor and angry at the rich.Even if the movie wanted to try to take a 'both sides' argument, it fails because the  actions of the working class were way worse than the actions of the upperclass.  The upperclass are the ones getting murdered in the streets. The working class are the ones idolising a killer clown. It seems very one sided.… Expand",7,8,"Oct 24, 2019"

I fear that the high reviews for some people on here are solely based on the acting or on it's message, or just reactionary because of criticisms the movie has received—and I think these are flawed measurements. What are its merits and deficiencies? First of all, the acting is excellent. Joaquin Phoenix is a favorite actor of mine and he does not disappoint! I am amazed that he can capture a character so well. His portrayal of the Joker is brilliant. The Joker is sad and disturbing. At different times of the movie, you feel tremendous empathy for the Joker—clearly he's gotten a rotten deal out of life and is deeply troubled—and at other times, he's terrifying. Less impressive...The movie is kind of slow moving, but never boring, at least to me. As has been said by the director and others, this movie is not your typical ""comic book"" movie—if you go into it expecting lots of actions, bombs, shootings, car chases, etc—you will be disappointed. (I actually appreciated that about the movie!) There is some of that, but this is by far, more of a drama with very little humor at all. Also, it's not a feel-good drama, the kind that you will want to see again and again. Now in terms of what I think was missing in the movie...the so called ""climatic, shocking, surprising ending"" was predictable. To me, the ending had only two real possibilities and the one I suspected is actually what happened. The ending was the low point of Joker; it began to break down into predictable patterns when I listened to the conversation between Joker and character Murray Franklin. It mostly sounded like the typical diatribe you find on a liberal college campus these days. The world has been unfair to Joker and therefore Joker will get even with the world. And the subtle message is that his violence and terrorism is a bit justifiable—finally the ""weak and ignored"" get their revenge. It also turns the whole Batman story on its head—it makes Joker out to be the hero and Thomas Wayne (and all the rich and powerful) to be the villains and jerks of society. Certainly this is true of some rich and powerful people in our world, but it's this kind of broad brush approach that frustrates me in a movie and the message ends up sounding like a Bernie Sander's campaign speech (no offense intended to Bernie or his supporters). The ending had the potential to be something different, something unconventional—even ambiguous would have been good.  (An illustration of what I mean from the Joker in the ""The Dark Knight"" movie: ""Do I really look like a guy with a plan? You know what I am? I'm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it! You know, I just... do things."" It was that frustrating ambiguity that made the Joker so interesting in The Dark Knight. He was evil to his core and we didn't need to feel sorry for him and we didn't need a justification for his insanity. The message: some people are just evil, without explanation. But in the movie, Joker, at its core, it sounded like a version of the same old retread theme we've been getting these days in shows and movies. All in all, not a bad movie, but I would say, save your money and rent it online cheaper when it comes out soon.… Expand",5,1,"Oct 25, 2019"

Not that it’s a bad thing, but outrage tends to overshadow movie's overall intentions. It’s no surprise that Joker ends up getting a nice share of the outrage, but it often leads the question: Is the film worth all the controversy or is it a small issue blown up into a big one?The film follows Arthur (Joaquin Phoenix) is older down on his luck man suffering through various mental illnesses, particularly his uncontrollable laughter in various scenarios. As his world crumbles around him, he finds himself teetering on reality and fantasy as he seeks to find some form of acceptance as he becomes the legend known as the Joker.This is no surprise when I say that Joaquin Phoenix pulls out an amazing performance as the Joker. He finds a perfect line trying to humanize his character's disability and bringing the viewer into his mind and often sweeping the rug under our feet with an “unreliable narrator” presentation where it makes you wonder what really happens and what doesn’t. The film gorgeously re-creates an early 1980’s New York aesthetic with the grime, trash and somehow frames it in a pretty well-shot way.The biggest problem is when portraying a character with disabilities, Director Todd Phillips shoots the film in the foot with often falling back on cliche old demeaning natures. Particularly one character who’s only character trait is his dwarfism and is often made fun of his height, that even involves a pretty dark scene later on which is hard to tell if it’s a payoff for a joke or not. Also, the film borrows a couple too many pages from Taxi Driver, which ironically stars Robert De Nero who’s in this film as well and is pretty great as a talk show host.Joker will divide many people and I think that’s the goal of the film. Many will like the portrayal of the villain, and many will dislike the violence and how certain things are represented.

The editing is also fantastic. They did an amazing job with both the visuals and audio cut. It is 100% worth going to see in theaters if you can for this reason alone. Phoenix's acting was absolutely stunning as well. His performance truly blew me away. The way he delivers each line forces the viewer to empathize with his character. I was not expecting this from this film, but gave me one of those moments where I said: ""Very few people could ever act on this caliber, he is gifted"". Beyond this, his physical performance was also spectacular. There are several scenes where he contorts his body in ways that could only be possible from a legitimate actor.In summary, this is a must watch or even buy in my opinion. I myself am usually quite cynical when it comes to most films for the reason that they tend to spew out unrealistic pleasantries to make the viewer feel good. I am usually screaming internally when this happens as it's usually pretty obvious. If you feel the same way, you will adore this movie. If you are the ""feel good"" type, you may not enjoy this film quite as much, but it is still worth watching solely for Phoenix's performance.… Expand",10,4,"Oct 26, 2019"

There's no denying the depth of Phoenix's performance, but it boils down to watching an entire movie featuring a tortured soul's life coming apart.  It is slow and grating, with some nod to the origin and interrelation of the Joker and Batman, but it's not worth the wait in the dark of the theater of of the Joke's life.  There is no real rhyme or reason to his elevation to folk hero for his murders, other than to introduce a ""commentary"" on the media's (now the  internet's) sudden ignition of wildfires of celebrity and the ""Resist"" movement in a bid for contemporary relevance. They should have introduced testimony from the woman on the train as to the dark side of the three ""preppy"" victims in order to make some sense of the riots, etc.  Without it, there's no reason for the uprisings.  Plus, I've got to say that the level of violence is way below what I expected in light of the controversy preceding the film's release.

The only part of the entire film that makes sense is the credits. The storyline and script are horrendous. The acting is distasteful at best. Pheonix does try with the script but still he is very contradicting. It shows proof he has this illness, then he acts like he doesn’t, back and forth over the entire film. It’s awful, forgetful, and doesn’t make any attempt of continuing the story from previous installments besides attempting to show his Batman’s parents death which still directly contradicts what has been told since the beginning.… Expand",0,3,"Oct 26, 2019"

E-Value: 9Acting: 9Plot: 9Unlike the previous DC movies (after 2012's The Dark Knight Rises) which is set in DC Extended Universe, Joker is a standalone movie which is separated from the shared universe franchise and starred Joaquin Phoenix as the titular character instead of Jared Leto, who previously portrayed the character in 2016's Suicide Squad.Set in the year of 1981, Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) lives in Gotham City with his mother, Penny Fleck (Conroy), and works a party clown to make ends meet. He also idolised the talk show host, Franklin Murray (De Niro) and wants to be like him one day. Life in Gotham City is very difficult for him because the city is filled with crimes, unemployment and society is very heavily divided between the rich and poor.Arthur also has a disorder which causes him to laugh at inappropriate times and he always relied on social services program for his medication. His life starts to get from bad to worse when he lost his job due to bringing a gun to a children's hospital while entertaining the children which is meant for his own protection and being sold out by his friend who gave him the gun to protect his own skin.The worst things happened to him does not stop there. After he lost his job, he gets beaten up by three drunken Wayne Enterprises employees in a subway train which forced him to kill two of them with his gun in self-defense and execute the last one when he attempts to escape. Not long after that, he loses access to his medication after the social services program got shut down due to budget cut and learns a horrifying truth about his mother along with his past. Arthur's fall to the path of darkness begins here.While it may not be part of the shared universe, this movie is really great and the tone is very dark and even better when combined with the plot which is very well written and executed. It is even darker than 2016's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and The Dark Knight Trilogy.What I love about the movie are the character developement and ambiguous nature. For the former, I love how Arthur Fleck's journey began from a nobody who is ignored by society until his transformation into an iconic villain being depicted. He worked very hard as working man but after all that hard work, he always ended up getting beaten, betrayed and even being mock by other people. All these bad things happened to him had led him to become a villain. All it takes to change a person was a ""one bad day"".For the latter, Todd Phillips managed to make the movie into an open ended and more than one interpretation. This is true to the source material because Joker does not really have an origin story in the comic book. In the comic book itself, Joker prefer his origin story to be a multiple choice. This multiple choice was used in the movie which really made you think whether which parts of his origin are true and what other parts are false. It is really up to audiences' interpretation. That is what made the movie plot really great.Joaquin Phoenix is really amazing in his performance as Joker. He put up a lot of effort in this role and he successfully nailed it. His dances in some scenes and his Joker laugh are very impressive. In addition, his version of Joker is right on par with the late Heath Ledger, who portrayed Joker in 2008's The Dark Knight. His acting skills is definitely an Oscars worthy be nominate as Best Actor and might even have the chance to win that award.This movie is truly a masterpiece for a low budget superhero (or supervillain in this case) movie. I would definitely recommend to watch this movie to everyone and not just comic book fans.… Expand",9,0,"Oct 26, 2019"

A particular film because it is an author film sold as a blockbuster under 17 years old. The plans are slow, working just like the light and the angle of approach not to mention the environments and the different places. This is the story of a character coming to embrace the madness of the world to make something of coloring red. The film is particularly good for his illness and is done in a rigorous way. Nothing has the area to be left to chance .. But I do not find this film excellent. It fits like a very good anti-hero movie such as we rarely see today alongside super-hero movies breaking the box office. The success of this joker can be because it fits in a time when the forbidden becomes allowed -17Ans, but especially that compare to what can do Marvel or DC; tries a sneakier and cinematic approach. Finally it may be the only movie that shows the cinema that we could see people fan of superheroes. That says a lot about our time. Thank youUn film particulier, car c'est un film d'auteur vendu comme un blockbuster moins de 17ans. Les plans sont lents, travailler tout comme la lumière et l'angle d'approche sans compter les environnements et les différents lieux. C'est l'histoire d'un personnage venant embrasser la folie du monde pour en faire quelque chose de colorier en rouge. Le film rend particulièrement bien sa maladie et le fait surtout de manière rigoureuse est prolongé. Rien n'a l'aire d'être laissée au hasard.. Pourtant je ne trouve pas ce film excellent. Il s'insère comme un très bon film d'antihéros tel qu'on en voit rarement aujourd'hui à côté des films de super héros qui casse le box-office. Le succès de ce joker vient peux être du fait qu'il s'insère dans une époque ou l'interdit devient permis #-17Ans, mais surtout que comparer à ce que peux faire Marvel ou DC; tente une approche plus sournoise et cinématographique. Finalement c'est peux être le seul film qui montre ce qu'est le cinéma qu'on pu voir les gens fan de super héros. Cela en dit long sur notre époque. Merci accompagnatrice… Expand",5,1,"Oct 27, 2019"

Despite a history of various actors completely nailing the role director Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix bring to life an extremely original take on this much beloved character. Arthur Fleck is a mentallyJoker is an absolute masterpiece. Despite a history of various actors completely nailing the role director Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix bring to life an extremely original take on this much beloved character. Arthur Fleck is a mentally ill professional clown with dreams of becoming a stand up comedian. But after a series of traumatic/hurtful experiences Arthur slowly begins to crack as he is edged closer and closer to insanity. Many critics including Peter Bradshaw (the guardian) have criticized joker for its ambiguous handling of morals and encouraging of violent behavior, however I can confirm that this is not the case. Although our protagonist is an extremely troubled man and his actions are far from virtuous, we don’t sympathise with Arthur because of his attributes as a person, but because of how badly he is treated by others. Todd Phillips does an excellent job of shining a light on real world problems, whether it be wealthy capitalists who don’t hold any concern for the poor or stage show hosts who practically make profit from ridiculing others. Although some of it may be a bit far fetched it is purposefully done this way in order to prevent the film from feeling too political. Joaquin Phoenix is outstanding In every aspect, and his performance is definitely Oscar worthy. The supporting cast as well, although not as heavily focused on, certainly never falter. Another feature that separates Joker from most films of its genre is steering clear of the trends of blockbuster action. When there is the occasional moment of violence it feels dark, gritty and shocking to say the least. Another problem that critics claim exists is that the film draws heavy inspiration from other movies such as the atmosphere in taxi driver or the riots from V for vendetta but once again I disagree, because the film does enough to feel different from all of them. There is so much more I could say to praise this film, but in order to not drag I’ll just leave out some of the less important details.… Expand",10,0,"Oct 29, 2019"

The music, cinematography, and the lead actor were incredible! The plot, pacing, and the idea that this was so supposed to be the Joker is the real joke here. Practically nothing was portrayed correctly in this movie from the comics or even other films or cartoons, and all that could be forgiven if they at least captured the essence of the character  however they did not. He was never really funny (even though comedy is subjective as Arthur states himself) he isn't really a criminal he just kind of stumbles and fumbles through every situation, and most importantly he wasn't smart or conniving. This is supposed to the legendary, the infamous, the iconic villain of Batman in the future? A weak, pathetic, mentally ill  clown that can't even keep a job or take care of his mother. Everything is handed to this character through plot driven circumstances. Oh the crowd just happens to get riled up just in time so he can slip through and meet Thomas Wayne. He didn't rile up the crowd, or plan a diversion how did he get a service outfit to blend in? Oh it was just laying around in a service closet just his size. The real Joker is smart and that is what allows him to go to to toe with the greatest detective of all time. He doesn't just get the luckiest circumstances in the world and just happens to beat Batman. He plans and schemes and puts on a show and actually knows how to be funny if he wants to be. The only reason I think this has good reviews is because my generation doesn't know the characters, and joaquin phoenix is an amazing artist bringing the role he was told to play to life. If this was a random movie about a random clown with mental illness and tragic story it would be a decent movie. As a movie supposedly portraying the Joker it was the worst movie DC has made so far. It was a movie made is if they don't understand their own character or why he is even so iconic or infamous in the first place.  Sincerely  a huge Joker fan… Expand",0,2,"Oct 31, 2019"

It's a great take on mental illness and bullying and how it affects the victim in a suspenseful way fitting for a psychological thriller. The movie draws inspiration from classic films with similar themes like ""The King of Comedy"". Robert De Niro's casting in the movie is fitting given his role in ""The King of Comedy"".Joaquin Phoenix does an amazing job playing The Joker. His performance is extremely flawless and beautiful. While Heath Ledger did a great job with Joker in The Dark Knight, Phoenix's performance is as great as the former, if not even better. Arthur Fleck's a very compelling character, as he goes through a ton of difficult stuff in his life, like bullying and such. He also has a ton of character development as he transforms into The Joker. His struggles also make the viewer want to be thrown into his world so that they can experience how he was treated. The film also works with Arthur's mental illness as it sometimes makes it harder for the viewer to know whether the events he's experiencing are real or not. The narrative also accurately portrays how Arthur's mental health progressively worsens through the film as he begins the movie as a sympathetic tragic person who continuously becomes more violent until he becomes a truly terrible person and a killer. While Arthur's conditions make him a sympathetic victim, his actions are still criminal and the move does paint him as a villain appropriately.The movie spreads a strong message on hatred, unfair class systems, the dangers of long-term suppression of emotions, abuse towards mental illness, among others with how Arthur is treated by society and his mental state. It also talks about how cruel people can be to others.Here are a couple of bad things about Although the movie's tackling of mental illness is profound, there are some inaccuracies. Some examples including The pseudobulbar affect, a medical condition that causes people to laugh uncontrollably is a physical disorder rather than a mental disorder. Given his severe declining mental condition towards the end of the movie, Arthur shouldn't have been able to outsmart the detectives. He shouldn't be able to interact with the interviewers after donning the full Joker outfit.What is the greatest two parts? The famous scene where Joker dances down the step street before he gets chased by the cops is amazing, in addition, the film takes place in at West 167th Street in Highbridge, and another scene where Joker is in a talk show with Franklin, and goes on a joke that society that abandons him and treats him like trash, and threatens him that he deserves him and he instantly kills Franklin is absolutely disturbing to watch.While the violent moments are infrequent when they do happen, they're intense enough to make the viewer feel uncomfortable with the psychological implications behind the violence.At the end of the film, we can see Bruce Wayne's family getting shoot by a protester, which it was nice to see Bruce Wayne before he becomes Batman.It's a very different take on a superhero movie, and it's refreshing to see.It uses the old Warner Bros. ""Big W"" logo at the beginning, fitting with the time period this movie is set in.Unlike other recent DC films that tried too hard to be dark and edgy, Joker manages to be dark and serious by doing it correctly and the dark tone of the film enhances the narrative.Joker is awesome, and I recommend you to see Joker! :) Hope you like my review! :)… Expand",10,1,"Sep  9, 2020"

Unfortunately this isn't just an origin story. 2019 joker is a Scorsese-ian quick paced masterpiece. It's deliberate script and demure violent tone seeks to get down to the depth of it's namesake villain. A carefully crafted descent into madness in a society already in the throes of exploitive capitalist violence gives the most chilling depiction of the joker since the charater consumed Heath Ledger. Joaquin Phoenix delivers an unhinged performance as the anti social traumatized Arthur who disenchanted with his life aspires to notoriety despite his own mediocrity. Following a succession of increasingly dispiriting events he begins to unravel just as the world around him burst open in unchecked anarchy . This movie is brilliant but as has been seen in similar art with white male protagonists who face mental illness whilst dealing with toxic masculinity, it has become canonized by the very audience it seeks to critique. Labeled a ""dude bro, female manipulator,white supremacist "" film isn't to far fetched. That might not be said by the films story itself but is a medium, through Arthur's self pitying isolation ,for their own failures. I do think the aforementioned consequence though further proves the films violent accuracy, just as Midsommar showed how easy it was to be brainwashed into a cult the joker shows us how easy it is to use trauma/mental illness to justify hurting other's. And that the joker shouldn't be admired or as his name suggests laughed at. But should instead be feared as his creation isn't fiction and instead manifests daily in the firm of school shooters,incels, misogynists and misanthropes. It's a warning, not a joke.… Expand",9,0,"Sep 30, 2022"
